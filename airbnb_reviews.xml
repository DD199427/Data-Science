Our stay with Marcus in Bristol was fantastic in every way! He was a great host - picking us up at the bus stop, recommending places to try, leaving plenty of pastries and other breakfast items to enjoy in the morning. The flat itself was modern, bright, clean and spacious - and best of all, right on Bristol's lovely harbourside. We will definitely stay again next time we're in Bristol - thanks again Marcus!

Marcus is a brilliant, warm and friendly host. He picked us up from therailway station, he took Anne to the doctor, and drove us aroundwherever we needed to go in Bristol and dropped us back at the railway station when we were leaving. His flat is very modern, comfortable and clean and is very well heated. Marcus provided us with everything we could wish for. We wish we could have stayed longer!!

My mum Angela and I have stayed at Marcus' amazing apartment for two weeks in August 2011, as I was relocating to Bristol. It was a lovely experience to be his hosts. The apartment is extremely confortable and located in a very nice area of Bristol, close to shops and several amenities. Marcus is a great person and provided us with all we needed, plus generous tips and practical help that made my relocation so much easier - and also fun! I recommend his company and place. They will be two special ingredients of your visit to Bristol and surrounding areas!

Marcus was an exceptional host. I only stayed for one night but he nicely offered to chauffeur me around Bristol when it was raining. He lives in a flat which is cavernous and its location on Harbourside is great. I'd stay again.

Marcus was welcoming, easy going and very helpful and informative.  His place is gorgeous and comfy and perfectly located for walking to everything - great restaurants, shops, and many places of interest.  We will stay there again if we can, and can  wholeheartedly recommend it.

Marcus is a a really great host. This was my first airbnb and travelled alone for work. I couldn't have stayed with a nicer person and the apartment is fantastic, located in a really happening area. I wish I had more time to explore Bristol though. So in all, Marcus is a really interesting person, good-hearted, and relaxed, the ideal host. And yes, I hope to return the favour to Marcus, if he comes to Ireland!

Wow, what an awesome experience.  Marcus did an excellent job of communicating with me which made it much easier to plan my trip.  Not only did he pick me up from the airport, but he dropped me off for my course the next morning and had a boatload of recommendations for great things to see and do in Bristol.  Excellent location, comfortable flat and generous host.  Very highly recommended

I really had a wonderful time in Bristol staying with Marcus.  He is a very friendly, hospitable and helpful host.  He collected me at the airport, took me to appointments, and even took me back to the airport after my visit.  I would highly recommend a visit to Marcus, and of course Bristol.

<title>
During my recent one night stay in Bristol, I found Marcus to be a very helpful and friendly host. Communication was excellent and he kindly let me work from his living-room for the whole day. His apartment is beautifully positioned by the harbour in the center of Bristol. Parking is free. The flat was clean, tidy and well appointed. I would definitely come back again.

I have never stayed anywhere better.- The space is clean, beautiful, quiet, and centrally located.  Its an incredible place, with a fantastic view overlooking the water and a 10-minute walk to anywhere.  - Marcus himself is kind, thoughtful, and helpful - yet strikes the perfect balance of providing you with your own space.  Basically he is there should you need help and provides fantastic conversation -- yet he also will leave you to yourself.  This balance is so important for me and marcus hit it out of the park.I will stay with marcus every time i go to bristol and so should you.

Although short, I had a very pleasant stay with Marcus. He was extremely helpful from the minute I got there until I left. The flat and the room were very nice, located conveniently to the city center and in a nice neighborhood. I hope I have the chance some day to go back with more time to explore the city and Marcus' company.

It was my first time with airbnb and I stayed in Marcus Fox's house for ten days. It was a real treat.From the first moment I met Markus to the last he overwhelmed me with his kindness and hospitality. The man has empathy he knows what you want even before you do and does it. Got a great apartment in Bristol Marina the most lively part of Bristol. Has private bathroom and toilet for his guests. He did my laundry twice. He picked me when I got there and left me when I was leaving with his car. Lent me his spare cellular phone when I needed it. Took me to Bath with his car, all free of charge, a true gentleman, exemplary human being. I went for a visit, gained a lifelong friend. Thank you Marcus.

Couldn't be more pleased with my experience staying at Marcus' place in Bristol. The location is beautiful -- next to a cool harbor with a great historic feel mixed with tons of great restaurants. The unit itself is very clean, minimalistic and comfortable. Marcus it a perfect host. I was so grateful he picked me up at the airport. He was very friendly, easy to talk to and very helpful. My only regret was my stay was so short. Hope to visit Bristol and Marcus again.

Marcus is a really nice host I ever met. He picked me and my brother from the bus station in his car. We stayed in a very beautiful double bedroom in his apartment. Unlike most other places, his bedroom has a separate toilet and shower for the guests. His fridge was full of food, and he offered to use whatever we like. So in a cheap price, we enjoyed our stay as we would in a 3 or 4 star hotel. Moreover, his house is very near to the train station.His house is located along a beautiful river, so the view was also very nice. I was there for a short stay, but I am sure that I will stay with Marcus again whenever I visit Bristol.
</title>

<title>
We had a lovely stay at Marcus's beautiful apartment. The place is so peaceful even though it is so close to the centre of the city. Can't recommend it highly enough. Marcus is a lovely, welcoming, hospitable guy and makes you feel at home straight away. Would love to go again. Thanks

I stayed with Marcus for almost two weeks.  Right from the start he was a wonderful host.  He made sure I had everything I needed but he never hovered.  I felt at home the moment I walked in.  He drove me places I needed to get to or made sure I knew how to get around on my own.  I went to Bristol for a purpose, to take a class.  The best part is I left with a new friend.  I look forward to staying with him again.

Marcus is definitely a 5-stars host. The apartment was so clean and tidy. It's 20 mins walking from Temple Meads train station and Marcus is willing to pick us up from the station whenever he's free. He is also very knowledgeable and sociable that we have no problem communicating with him. Will definitely stay with him again the next time we visit Bristol.

 Marcus was a welcoming  and helpful host.His modern apartment suited us down to the ground being right in the centre of the Bristol quayarea and only  metres from the SS Great Britain. He gave us lots of local information  like where to get the best meals and local transport.He was a generous host who welcomed a chat.We enjoyed meeting him.

Marcus was a wonderful host, very accommodating and easy going. The place is fantastic, and I had it all to myself for the majority of the stay which was great. The town center is a short and pleasant walk away, just down the harbour front, past MShed. Sometimes on Sunday afternoons a small steam train will saunter past the balcony! Highly recommended if you need a nice place to stay in Bristol.
</title>
</document>
<document id="29">
<title>
Marcus went above and beyond what anyone else would have done to make me feel comfortable and settled. His place is the perfect location, if you want to go around City Centre. Please take him up on the suggestion of using the Cross Harbour Ferry and the water taxi, they get you where you need to go very quickly. If you're looking for a nice place, nice room, without any hassle, Marcus in your guy. You won't be disappointed.

Marcus was very kind and truly offered a wonderful and comfortable experience. The apartment is new and well kept with all comforts, and well positioned overlooking the river close by the happening harbour side area. I enjoyed staying with Marcus and really appreciated all his efforts in providing I would say a "hotel like experience" in terms of service but in a beautiful flat in Bristol city center.Thank you again for the great stay.

My time with Marcus was amazing from beginning to end. He picked me up from the train station with no problems, the accommodation was perfect and more then I could of asked. He was willing to help me with any questions I had about Bristol. I felt like I was at home and at a 5 star hotel at the same time. When I come back to bristol I will not hesitate to see if the room is available again.

<title>
Marcus is a great host. He not only picked me up at the train station when I arrived and brought me back, but specifically went out to buy breakfast items that I could eat (I have several food intolerances). The flat is lovely, very comfortable, tastefully decorated, and in a really convenient location. The only downfall was that I was only there for a brief stay!

Great stay. Marcus really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome, including picking us up from the airport. The apartment was kept in extremely good condition, and the location was convenient for exploring the city. Couldn't have asked for more.

Marcus is a wonderful, friendly host. Because of the nature of my work hours, we didn't see each other that much, but the listing was totally accurate and the location is very central - I'd stay here again next time I'm in Bristol for sure. A really beautifully furnished flat and Marcus really makes you feel at home!

This was a great apartment to stay in, clean, modern and spacious.

I loved staying at Marcus' place. He was such a kind and considerate host, and went out of his way to make me feel welcome, even picking me up from the bus station with all my luggage! He was also very flexible on arrival and departure times. The accommodation is a very comfortable and clean room with everything you could possibly want in the flat, a friendly housemate, and a great location close to the harbour. I would happily stay here again. Thanks Marcus!

The apartment was perfect, a nice location with car parking a few minute from the centre.Communication, cleanliness and convenience were all top notch and I'd have hesitation recommending Marcus and his apartment to other AirBnb'ers. Thank you.

Arrived to Bristol Temple Meads train station after a weekend in Paris where Marcus picked me up. Stayed one night in Marcus's flat before heading off for a business trip. His flat was comfortable and homey. After several days of traveling and several more ahead of me, Marcus made me feel at home in his place. Bristol is a great city and the location of Marcus's flat is excellent for walking around and touring the town. Marcus is an experienced Airbnb host and was generous enough to pick me up from the train station and arrange a taxi for me when I needed to leave. I will definately be looking to stay here again when I return to Bristol. Thanks Marcus!

Marcus was absolutely wonderful in making us feel welcomed. He picked us up from the station and showed us the ropes of his lovely clean apartment. It was exactly as it was on the photos, and the area is as convenient as expected, minutes away from the beautiful harbour.
</title>

<document id="43">
<title>
Marcus was very friendly and helpful. He helped me move all my luggage up to the room (I had many bags with me) and on the day I leave he drove me to town. He made a warm welcome to me and it is a very nice place to stay. The room is big and I got access to the kitchen which I could cook. Place was nice and clean and the ensuite was big.

We absolutely loved staying with Marcus and highly recommend. He was very welcoming and helpful which made  us feel comfortable in his home. It was the first time we had used Air b&b as a family and will definetly do it again, hopefully they are all like Marcus! We had our 1 year old daughter with us which wasn't an issue for Marcus at all, he really is a wonderful host. We would love to go and see him again.

We had an excellent stay with Marcus. He was a very gracious host, even offering to pick us up and take us back to the train station (we decided to walk so we could see more of the city - it's less than 30min by foot). The flat itself is very nice, and our room, with en suite toilet, was immaculate. The flat is in a pleasant and quite convenient part of town; it's just a few minutes to get into the centre. No complaints at all - we had a lovely time. Thanks very much, Marcus.

I had an absolutely great time at Marcus's. He is such a nice person and very easy to talk to. It was very nice of him to pick me up and take me back to the station.

Marcus' place is awesome. As a host, he goes out of his way to welcome guests. He genuinely ensures that guests feel comfortable and can use the kitchen, washer and drier, etc. He is sociable and friendly but both he, and the setup also provide quiet and privacy.The room and ensuite are clean and set out like a great four star hotel room. Luxurious rain shower, huge fluffy white towels, bath robe and slippers. I stayed for over a week, so the super-efficient washer and drier were a fantastic bonus.Location is good with the harbourside right outside the door.

Our host was extremely welcoming and couldn't have been more helpful.  He met us at the entrance to the car park and saw us safely in to the space, and made sure that we had mastered the entry system: we liked him.  The flat is well appointed with a very modern and uncluttered feel and the room was spacious with a large en suite.  This was the first time we had used Airbnb so we had been unsure what to expect, but after this experience we will certainly be back and if we are visiting Bristol we will check out the availablity here.

I had a great time in Bristol and meeting Marcus was one of the highlights. Everything was effortless and he was a fantastic host. The flat was perfect and en suite spotless. On a further note I recommend it to any Star Wars fan, but you'll have to book to find out why!

Me and my wife were visiting Bristol for one night and this apartment  was a perfect location for us.  In a quiet spot by the river but close enough to walk to the town.  Marcus was away for the weekend so we were alone in the apartment and communication prior to our arrival was excellent with clear directions given. The apartment itself is just like the photos, very clean, smart with a lovely bedroom and very nice en-suite. It was everything we needed for our one night stay.  We would recommend this apartment and would be happy to stay here again.

As an airbnb virgin, Macus was the perfect host. Prior to my visit there was great communication. On arrival Marcus was there to meet and greet. The accommodation on offer is in the perfect location, walking distance from the city centre and views of the S.S GREAT Britain from the doorstep. The apartment is just as described in the add plus more. Its spacious, spotless, yet homely and comfortable. A comfortable bed making for a great night sleep, with a fantasic powerful shower to awaken one, with added personal toiletries as a thoughful touch as so easy to forget when packing.Not forgetting the on site sauna and gym available.As for Marcus, a delightful intelligent individual who goes out of his way to make a guest feel welcome. Whilst I enjoyed his company and conversation he also knows how to read a situation giving one personal space if required. A perfect gentleman and pleasure to meet. Overall I cannot praise Marcus and the accommodation on offer enough and once again  would like to say "A Big Thank You" to a great host. I am happy to recommend to anyone, its great value for money and I am already planning my next visit.

Marcus is a super(b) host! He proactively reached out about helping me get to his apartment and generously drove me to and from the station at Bristol as I went about local getaways. The views from his balcony capture the quay in all their charm and several city sites are walkable or accessible by public transport. In the home there is breakfast, a well stocked bath care closet and the room is spacious and comfortable. A modern space, his living area and kitchenette are accessible too. It was wonderful exchanging notes on travel, culture and the airbnb fraternity with him. He's also flexible about schedules and made being in another city seem very easy. I'd say - book with him if you can. :)

My trip to Bristol was a real pleasure thanks to Marcus. The room far exceeded my expectations and it had its own bathroom. Everywhere was spotlesly clean and it was better than staying in a good quality hotel. The apartment was in easy walking distance of the town centre and the view over the river was an added bonus. Marcus was the perfect host and he made me feel like I was an old friend. Marcus makes staying with him an enjoyable and relaxing experience nothing is too much trouble. I will definately be going back to Bristol for another visit.

Marcus' apartment is located very conveniently close to both the center of Bristol and the University campus. Both the room and the apartment are clean and modern, bonus points for the view over the river Avon and the harbourside. Marcus was a great host and provided me with everything needed. He is super friendly and offered to pick me up from the train station or buy groceries for me if necessary. Overall, a wonderful experience :)

<title>
This was my first experience with Airbnb and I should admit that thanks to our wonderful host Marcus this experience exceeded all our expectations. The apartment is perfectly located right on the river side and close to the city center and all major sightseeing spots. This is a mordern, spacious, nicely decorated apartment with a very cosy and comfortable guast room which also has its own bathroom. Everything was clean, well prepared for our visit and I really doubt we would have felt better in a hotel rather than in this apartment. Additional benefit of the flat is its tremendous view over the river and the harbour. A separate word I'd like to say about Marcus. Marcus is a superb host, very attentive and responsive to any question or concern you may have during your stay. He made all his best for we could really feel like at home while staying at his place. Having  said the above I would definitely recommend Marcus as a host and his fantastic apartment for your next visit to Bristol.

Marcus was an awesome host! He text me beforehand and asked if I needed any assistance in getting to him. He provided a parking space and showed me around the building and his gorgeous apartment.We sat and chatted for a while and he really made me feel welcome and at ease as it was my first time using Air BNB.He left me a colouring book which was so sweet and plenty of bits in the fridge, which I was welcome to help myself to. The en-suite was beautifully stocked, better than a hotel room, and the room and en-suite itself were gorgeous.I was lucky enough to have the apartment to myself, and although there was a TV in the room, I enjoyed watching the huge TV in the lounge and looking out over the balcony to the Harbour. It was a great location for me as I was visiting Vegfest at the amphitheatre and it was just a 10 minute walk to get there.A gorgeous location and a great host, I'd recommend staying at Marcus's to anyone and will definitely be staying with him again next time I visit Bristol!Thank you Marcus!

Marcus was a fantastic host and did everything he could to make us feel very welcome, not least by picking us up from the train station, which was very generous and very much appreciated. It also gave a good opportunity to spent a bit more time on introductions and background stories, which never fails to be interesting. Marcus' place was in a great location, very convenient for all the good bits of Bristol, and was extremely comfortable and well supplied. We loved the bathroom in particular, great shower, and such soft towels! It was a pleasure meeting Marcus and we'd happily visit again when in Bristol.

Marcus was very flexible with our check in and check out times, which was very useful.  Marcus was a great host, very relaxed and easy-going and made our first stay in an Air bnb a pleasant experience,  and knows Bristol very well and so can provide information on where to go and directions within the city.  The apartment is spacious and the bedroom provided is very comfortable with a great ensuite shower room.

Marcus was very friendly. He met us on arrival, let us use his garage and made us feel very welcome. Our room was very clean, lovely comfy bed and big ensuite shower room. The area was very close to where we were due out to dinner so we were able to walk there an back so all very easy.

One of the best, if not THE best Airbnb I ever went to. Marcus is a great host and the communication with him was easy. He took us at the airport with his car and so he made the check-in really comfortable. I recommend it!

Marcus is a fantastic host, he went completely out of his way the whole time we stayed to ensure our trip was amazing. He was very generous and helpful. His place was so lovely to stay in, superb shower, fluffy towels and very comfortable bed. His place is in a great location so handy to the city and restaurants and bars. We wished we could have stayed longer.

Marcus is one of the friendliest and most accommodating hosts I've ever had. He was super flexible, a really prompt communicator and his flat is all you could possibly hope for, central, clean, and super comfortable. The bed especially was one of the best of I've ever slept on.

Excellent clean and comfortable room in a great apartment fitted out to a very high standard.  Very wecolming and friendly host but this place would also suit anyone requiring their own space and privacy.  I stay in the local hotels and this room is not only to a higher standard but is way better value for money so I'll definitely be returning.

Marcus is someone who goes out of his way to make guests feel welcome during their stay. He is available to answer any questions and also provides good conversation. The flat is spacious and clean as is the room itself. Marcus genuinely looks after the property and always strives to provide a service of great value to guests. I would highly recommend this property for people looking to stay at a central location in Bristol.

Great location and modern apartment. Marcus left everything ready for a comfortable night in Bristol.  Will probably repeat on any following visit to town. 
</title>
</document>
<document id="95">
<title>
If you want to visit Bristol...stay here!! The apartment is clean, secure, comfortable and there is plenty of space. The location is amazing and really close to all amenities for the daytime such as shops and cafes and all the nightlife for the evening as well. We strolled into town along the harbour front which felt quite luxurious on our 'girls weekend'. In fact, everything felt that way right down to the towels and that upon our arrival all the little things that really matter when you travel were there for us; like bottled water and breakfast for the morning.  We didn't have to worry at all. Ladies, with two bathrooms that were both sparkling, you have enough space to get even more beautiful. ( In this instance we were 3 and had the whole apartment to ourselves- which Marcus made possible) The check- in and out times were really generous which is what you need for weekend trips to unwind.Marcus is a phenomenal host and went way way out of his way to welcome us on our visit. We will 100% be back for that morning after sauna and for the lovliness that was Marcus himself.

Marcus was an excellent host, very helpful and responded to all my emails promptly. The apartment was not only in brilliant condition but also had everything you could possibly need including breakfast in the morning, bathroom essentials and speakers to name a few. The location was also ideal to explore Bristol and underground parking was a bonus!

The place is a lot nicer than the pictures which was a very nice surprise. He has every essential you could need so you can travel light. He is very friendly and helpful. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. Also has a printer, WiFi, adaptors, things you need but would be quite the hassle to use on a trip.

Amazing!!  Marcus & his home are wonderful (photos do not do it justice). Perfect location and great amenities and facilities. I feel I have made a lifelong friend and can't wait to visit again. Marcus makes you feel so at ease (so much so I cancelled all plans and just stayed and chilled in the house-exactly what lazy weekends are designed for).
</title>

<title>
As a Airbnb first timer I think I really struck lucky when choosing to stay with Marcus. I am a full time power wheelchair user and as such am always worried that a place might not be accessible but I need not have worried. I couldn't use the shower but that's a small detail compared to everything else. Marcus was a delight full host and could not have been more welcoming and understanding. His apartment which has wonderful view, was clean and fully accessible. Marcus found time to chat which I thoroughly  enjoyed. I would recommend his place to anyone with mobility issues or not.

<title>
What a great find. The room is better than the pictures portrays the shared space is stunning. Marcus couldn't do enough for us. I was amazed when he met me at the bus station, which was such a relief after a long journey. Marcus provides everything you could possibly need. I will not hesitate to return.

This is was the second time that I stayed with Marcus and if I’m ever in Bristol I’d reach out to him in a heart beat. A clean, tasteful, comfortable place will await you and Marcus’s hospitality - he generously walked me to my conference venue and gave me a ride when I was out rather late () and shared notes on the city and travel - will leave you feeling like you have a friend in an unknown city. The place has elevator access, is 10 minute walk from a grocery storepharmacy and wonderful bistros and art showing. It also overlooks the water and you can grab breakfast before you head out. Don’t miss the sauna and gym if you have the time. Above all - go because this super host is truly fun to meet and stay with!

<title>
From start to finish, staying with Marcus was a 5-Star experience. He kindly picked me up from the train station, and then talked to me about what to see and do during my short trip to Bristol. He drove me to the Clifton Suspension Bridge so I wouldn’t have to do the trek UP and could enjoy the views on my way DOWN. His apartment is ideally situated - walking distance to most major cultural attractions - and my room was quite literally as nice as many upscale hotels. Marcus will be the first host I reach out to when I’m back in Bristol. I would definitely recommend him! Thanks, Marcus!

Marcus’s place is close to the city Center, right next to the harbour. With good views over balcony and the flat itself is very spacious. Getting into city Center is really convenient around 20mins walk around the beautiful and charming harbour.Marcus have been very kind to me, bringing me around Bristol and helped me for a lot of things. He is very easy going and it is a pleasure to live in his place.I would highly recommend his place to anyone and I would very happily stay in his place again.Edwin

Had a great stay with Marcus. His apartment is lovely - clean, tidy and convenient, with lots of thoughtful touches. And Marcus couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful - he picked me up at the station, and gave me lifts to a couple of places, provided a map and local tips, and was entirely relaxed, which made it easy to feel at home. Thanks for a great stay! :)

This was a 5-star accommodation all the way. The room and en suite bathroom were spacious, as was the apartment itself. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was one of the best we've encountered. But the best part of the apartment was Marcus. He was really the perfect host: attentive and friendly without being intrusive, generous and interesting. We highly recommend this listing.

Marcus and his place are both fantastic! One of the most comfortable apartments I've stayed in so far with a perfect location.

Marcus place is very clean tidy. Communication with MArcus was great. quick response.This was my work related trip booked at very last moment. Marcus informed me that he won't be there personally but will take care of checkin etc and if it is a problem for me. As I live in England this was not be an issue for me. Ofcourse need him available over phone in case any issue. Marcus instructions were spot on. He arranged his friend Robin to let my car in. Robin is very polite and helpful.Place was clean, Marcus was in touch with me if I need anything.Place is close to where I had to go and harbour side. his flat is kind of south east side so will be pleasant for most of the time of the year.Things could have been better in this trip:-MArcus was supposed to come back during mid week but his trip got extended and I couldn't meet him personally. Although this didn't impacted at all on quality of my stay and  Marcus was available over phone all the time but it would have been nice to meet him. He came back in the afternoon the day I checked out (I checked out in the morning).  he did invited me to his place to get fresh and coffee but I had to go back to my family so I turned it down. Hopefully will meet him sometime.I will recommend staying in Marcus's  place.

Marcus was a really a great host, the location is perfect if you're planning to be within walking distance of Bristol town centre; there is also nearby public transport links too if you're planning to go outside of the local area. The apartment is very spacious, comfortable and absolutely spotless! We couldn't fault Marcus on anything, we would thoroughly recommend that you stay here if you're planning a trip within the area.

There are two things that contribute to an enjoyable stay; the accommodation and the host. In this case, they are both as close to perfection as I have experienced anywhere.The apartment is light, clean and very attractively laid out. The guest bedroom has an en-suite and there are many nice touches like a bathrobe and the option of hard and soft pillows - and plenty of towels. Secure off-road parking within walking distance of the centre of Bristol is a real bonus!Marcus is an exceptional host. He is attentive when you need him, but also able to leave you alone when you need some space. His 'induction' process was flawless and I really appreciated the dry-run of the entry and exit process. Marcus is intelligent and thoughtful and so kind that even though I was in Bristol for work, when I arrived home I felt like I had been on holiday.I loved the huge mugs of tea, the movie chat and the variety of breakfast cereal - but I can't believe Marcus actually liked Ridley Scott's disastrous Alien prequel "Prometheus". I'm already planning a return visit with notes and a short presentation to explain just why that film is so bad!

We stayed with Orla and her cat Figgy on Friday night during our weekend visit to Bristol, Bath and then Cardiff. She was an excellent host, especially for her first time! Her house is very cute and comfortable. Orla was very friendly and accommodating, making us tea and coffee when we arrived, making sure we slept comfortably and concerned herself with checking the air mattress in the morning. She cooked us porriage even though breakfast was not mentioned on her airbnb entry. She was very helpful, showing us maps and giving us advice about getting to different places of interest in her area. Orla was also very kind in offering to let us keep our bags at her place the following day after checkout while we spent the whole day exploring Bristol and Bath. 
</title>

Stayed two nights in Orla's place while visiting Bristol and was made to fell welcome. Great central accom. and interesting helpful peeps in the house so thanks again Orla and co.

<title>
Great host, the place was clean and Orla is super friendly. I stayed there for a little over 3 weeks while I was waiting for my flat to be available.If you are a tourist is a great place to stay in Bristol city centre is 20 minutes walking. 
</title>
</document>
<document id="143">
<title>
Staying with Orla was really easy. She was really warm and helpful and I had no problems at all. The cottage has a lot of charm from sitting out the front among the veg garden to admiring the lovely Tom Cruise photo in the hallway.
</title>
</document>
<document id="144">
<title>
Orla was a very helpful host, letting us check in during the day and even do some washing while we were there.  The house is in a great location with only a 15-20min walk to Bristol City Centre and close to supermarketsrestaurants. The rooms was comfortable and spacious. 
</title>

<title>
I highly recommend staying with Orla if you plan on visiting Britol. It's a quick walk to the downtown area from her place where there are cathedrals, museums, and Banksies galore.  What's more is that Orla is a gracious host that is fun to talk with.  I felt an immediate comfort from her and her place that I feel would be unlikely had I stayed at any number of other places.  Also, she was understanding of my beginners follies at Airbnbing.  A true pro!
</title>
</document>
<document id="146">
<title>
Orla was a perfect host. To greeting there was tea and we could take our dinner in her beautiful garden. We were three persons, two days, in one room. The space has fitted perfectly. Orla gave us wonderful tips where we can go. Since her house is quite central, we could run everything. We had a great stay and I highly recommend Bristol and Orlas accommodation!

Orla and Vince made me feel like home and showed the way around the kitchen and the rest of the property. The house was comfortable and lovely decorated. Bedminster is a lively place and the area well worth exploring and the city center is just 20 minute walk away. So regardless you are travelling for work or leisure, Orla will surely take care of you.

Orla was a lovely welcoming host, giving me a tour of the house and a cup of tea when I got in fairly late from a train. I stayed in the basement room, which is well kitted out with desk, clothes rail, shelves, hairdryer, and a large, comfy bed. No traffic noise as the room is away from any roads, and there is a decent blind so the room is dark. The house itself is about 20 minutes walk into the city centre over the river. I had two good nights here- thank you!

<document id="154">
<title>
It's been fun being here. Orla is a nice host and the house is charming. The room is not very suitable for 4 persons however, 2 persons is better. Also, if you want your accommodations to be super tidy and clean, this is not the place for you. The neighbourhood is great, lots of shops around and it's not too far from the center, you can walk or take a bus. It's got that rough edge (but not too much) that makes Bristol interesting compared to some other English cities we visited :)

I spent more than 1 month by Orla, who is a wonderful person. I had a very great time by her and spent a lot of time in her beautiful cottage. We had a very good contact, shared meals together, had great conversations. I definitely recommend Orla's place! And hope to see her again in Switzerland as soon as possible.

Quirky house, comfortable & as per description. Loved the vintage furniture! Walkable distance to the centre, or cheap via taxi too. Thanks for your local recommendations too!

<title>
Orla is a great host. She is very friendly and easy-going and her cat is lovely as well! The house is tidy and in a silent and safe area, what is very important for me as an alone-travelling woman. In a few steps you can reach North Street a very lively street with lots of shops, restaurants and cafés (could highly recommend Margot May) and street art.The house is also very well connected to the city center, you can walk in approx. 20-30 minutes to the center and in approx. 40 minutes to stokes croft. The connection to Clifton and all other parts of Bristol (if you like to avoid walking) via bus is also very well. Thank you again Orla, for making my stay in Bristol so pleasant!

I had the pleasure of staying 3 nights at Orla's house which has a nice creative ambience, reflective of its owner. The room was spacious and comfortable and I was made to feel very welcome. This is a great area for independent shops, good eateries and pubs (plus lots of charity shops) and is close to the river and waterfront. Orla was both helpful with local advice and interesting to talk to.
</title>

<document id="165">
<title>
Really nice interior! And the Check-In was possible at 1:30 AM as well which is a big plus!
</title>
</document>
<document id="166">
<title>
Orla was very welcoming and left us clear instructions for our arrival as we did not arrive until late in the evening. The house was easy enough to find despite not having any road frontage and we were able to leave the car in Diamond Street car park as suggested. The area of Bedminster seemed rather run down in our opinion rather than being Hipster however this is probably just a difference in opinion as we did not have time to properly explore what bedminster had to offer. The proximity to Bristol city centre meant that it served our purpose well as we were at a friends wedding. The nearby options for breakfast were limited as we needed breakfast before 10am we had to drive to a more central cafe as we didn’t fancy a Spoons breakfast which was the closest option to the house. The basement room was comfortable however the bathroom  kitchen could have been slightly cleaner.Orla was friendly and her house provided a greatmuch cheaper alternative to staying in a hotel. For anyone looking for a crash pad reasonably close to Bristol Centre Orlas house was ideal.

Place was lovely, great location to nearby bars and cafés. Olra is an amazing host and very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. We were made to feel very welcome and at home whilst given our own space. Parking was easy - if the carpark’s full there is always a street spot nearby.

<title>
Orla's place is cosy and homey with great colours, a sweet terraced cottage with an arty, relaxed atmosphere. Off the main road, so it's incredibly peaceful and quiet. It just feels like staying at a friend's place, very laid back, very friendly and casual, and everything works really well. Nice shower, and a very comfy bed, with pretty vintage bedding. The downstairs room is in the old coal cellar but it's brilliant, with a very clever skylight and a nice feel. I was happy to spend a whole afternoon in there working. Orla herself is great, very friendly and interesting and welcoming - it was just the right mix of sociability and space.

Orla is an open minded host with a great eye for kitsch - the room is decorated with all sorts of fun things. Local information is provided and there are lots of helpful notes around the house to point guests in the right direction for recycling etcetera.  The area is convenient for the city centre, especially if you're cycling, and has some interesting shops and places to eat nearby.

Orla is a great host. Nice to have a chat with her, but not invasive. She's respectful of your privacy.  She provided useful information on how to move around Bristol.The location is good, with some places to eat nearby. Buses that go to the city centre and the airport are just around the corner. The neighborhood is very quiet and feels safe enough to walk around even late in the evening.However, the cleanliness of bathroom  kitchen can be improved.

Orla  and her lovely cat are wonderful hosts who make you feel at home instantly.Her cute and cosy cottage is in a perfect position for exploring Bristol and close to great restaurants, bars and supermarkets. Highly recommend staying with Orla...when you next visit Bristol.

I had a comfortable stay, with a roomy basement bedroom which was warm and clean. The bathroom, which was up 2 flights of stairs,  was also clean, with plenty of hot water.

<document id="195">
<title>
Orla's place is not like most other airbnb's that i've been in, where its a plain room. The room provided is quite cosy and decorated quite tastefully. Orla was a great host too, providing information on what to do, where to go in Bristol. Transport to the city centre was nearby , the bus stop being just a 5minute walk down.There's also quite a few restaurants nearby so even at 9pm you can find food to eat even late at night.You might want to bring your own house slippers though since the floor may be sticky in the kitchen.

Quirky, stylish little place, convenient for town centre. Cleanliness could be better, but comfiest bed I've used for a while. Recommended for a short stay.

This is probably the best experience I’ve had on Airbnb so far. The house is cozy and Orla is very friendly and welcoming. There are multiple shops, bus stops, places to eat and parks nearby, yet the house is tucked away in a quiet street. The room was clean, tidy and comfortable. I felt right at home here and enjoyed my stay very much, and I highly recommend it!

Orla is very friendly and available. She has been good advise for getting around and going out for food and drink. Her flat is very well located in a lively area of Bristol, very quiet...apart from hungry seagulls in the morning maybe :-) if coming by car it is easy to find free carpark in streets nearby, very close to center (10 to 15 mn walk from M Shed). I recommand staying at Orla's.
</title>
</document>
<document id="202">
<title>
Orla was great! The location is in a cool part of Bristol with it's own distinct neighborhoody feel. The house is down a quaint little row of houses, and is itself a very good size. The room for rent is super cozy, has a nice old world feel to it yet clean and with a very typical English looking view out of the window. I felt very at home and comfortable. Halfway through my stay Orla reorganized the furniture in two of the rooms downstairs, upon coming home I thought it was a completely different house! You can tell she takes pride in her place and wants her guests to be comfortable. Next time in Bristol I'll definitely book again !

Orla was really nice and flexible. She's made my stay very smooth and always ensured I had everything I needed. The room was as shown in the picture and had good storage space.

Had a great stay with Orla!Her home was so cute and quirky and she made us feel at home straight away.We had our our own room, bed was really comfy and amenities were brilliant. Orla's place is a 2 min walk from a bus stop that takes you straight into the centre of town as well as to the buscoach station and Temple Meads Train Station.We stayed 2 nights and Orla (& Vince) made our stay in Bristol thoroughly enjoyable.I wouldn't hesitate recommending her or going back to stay!ohh and Figgy, the cat, is adorable! :)Thanks Orla! x

I stayed with Orla for a few weeks this August.  She was a great host - friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable about the local area.  Her cottage has loads of character, and the room was clean with a comfy bed and plenty of space.

Orla's place was very nice and quaint. She was not around when i arrive but her boyfriend Vince was around to help me open the door and carry my bag up. I was quite lost looking for their place, although very near to the main road, one could get very confused with all the small alleys, especially in the evening. Eventually i manage to meet her later that evening when she got back, she was very nice and welcoming. I had to do a course just across the street so her place was more than convenient for me, u can just take the bus if you wanted to go to the city. Overall i would recommend her place especially for solo travellers (i booked the single room) who needs something affordable in Bristol.

Perfect for me, welcoming and helpful host, place lived upto my expectations, great bookshelves, individual decor and furnishings. Reasonable walking distance from station, easy walk to @bristol (and Arnofolni, etc.) my destination. This place is lived in with individual decor and sh furnishings, to me its great appeal but if you are after everything new and uniform it may not be for you.

<title>
Definitely a must if you plan to spend a few days in Bristol. The house is stylish and has everything you may need. What is more important, the neighborhood is really quite, so your rest is guaranteed. Besides, there are several super markets around the area. Hosts Orla and Vince are really nice and welcoming.

A very comfortable house only a short walk from the city centre. Restaurants, supermarkets, and public transport are all close by. The house is located in a quiet laneway, and the bed is very comfortable. Orla and Vince are friendly and welcoming. Thanks for a great stay!

Orla is a wonderfully friendly, gracious host, and her home is incredibly cosy and welcoming -  I've had a great time staying with her. The house is in a well serviced location with plenty of local transport links, from which it's easy to explore Bristol and the surrounding areas. Though I've been in and out quite a lot, Orla has been really accomodating, and it's a very relaxed household. I highly recommend her as a host! =D

Orla offers a really cozy living environment and a clean, stylish bedroom for you to use as a base while exploring Bristol. I stayed in the white room which was perfect for my needs - a comfortable bed and a little desk for my interview prep. Orla's a relaxed host who will happily share a cup of tea with you (or a glass of wine) while letting you get on with your own thing.  The location is right by North Street, which is filled with lots of cute shops and restaurants so I had fun wondering around when I had free time.

It was my first experience with Airbnb, and I was lucky that my host was Wendy. I spent one month at her home and I very appreciated her attitude to life, her willingness to share her own home with me and one another guest. In spite of my English wasn´t good, Wendy spoke to me and was very helpful if I needed. This experience has affected me only in positive way. If I am back in Bristol, I will definitely check availability of Wendy´s home again. I can recommend this temporary home especially for long term staying. There is necessary to respect very basic rules in Wendy´s house, which are assumption for coexisting and sharing same place for life. The house is situated in a calm part of city, and I used the walking and cycling path to get to school in the city centre every day. It was easiest connection between home and city centre. But it is possible to use the bus as well.There is no problem to discuss everything with Wendy, if you need to find out more about possibilities of staying.I wish Wendy all the best.  Thank you :-)

Wendy is very open-minded and easy to talk to. I enjoyed my first travel with Airbnb thanks to her. Thanks a lot! It seemed that she always cared about guests. You will probably be satisfied when you talk to her if you are in trouble.I did not feel cold when I was in the room in December thanks to having a heater. The room is easily accessible by public transport. It is less than 15 minutes walk from a bus stop or a railway station to the city center.

I had a really long stay in Wendy's lovely home.I am so happy that I found such a nice place like hers. It was the first time staying away from my family home but living with Wendy made it so much easier for me. From the first day she made me feel being welcomed. We also had nice conversations and she helped me out if I needed information about Bristol or other things.So I would say she is the most trustworthy and warm person I have ever met. Her home is near to the city Centre and to all public transportations (e. g. Bus, train) and all the information in her description are accurate.I would highly recommend this place for short and long stays!Thank you so much!

AVOID THIS AIRBNB AT ALL COSTS!!! My partner and I booked here for just under two weeks. When we booked we read in the rules that the host had allergies to strong perfumes. I was fine with this and did not use perfume during my stay. However after arriving the host told us we can not use any perfumed products such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair spray, deodorant or body lotion. We were unaware of this as it was not stated in the Airbnb description. After speaking with the host we agreed that we will not use these products for her health. The reason I am writing this review is not only because I strongly feel this host should not be allowed to Airbnb with an allergy to products that everyone uses on a daily basis but because of how invasive the host was. When booking the Airbnb I read that the host likes to say hello and have the occasional conversation which I was very happy to do as I work full time and my partner and I like to keep to ourselves. However while I was at work and my partner was home all day he called me and informed me of how Wendy had called him more than four times on different occasions pestering him to either ask him questions or to do something for her. My partner and I are very polite people who want to please others so we were pleasant with Wendy. After a few days into our stay Wendy become very intrusive in our cooking although we were very respectful and clean, she would knock on our door very often asking us to do silly things like close the bathroom door and when we assured her it wasn’t us that left it open and that it was the other Airbnb guest she told us that this was not true and that it was us. On another occasion we had cooked and Wendy asked us to clean and scrub the oven as she believed we were the only guests that used it however this accusation was once again proved wrong when myself and Charlie saw the other guest using the oven.  We were more than happy to do this and told her we will do it in an hour when the oven is cooler so we do not burn ourselves. 45 minutes later Wendy knocks on our door and asks why we haven’t cleaned the oven. We tell her that we will come down in a moment to do it. She becomes very irritated and walks out of the room huffy and saying quote ‘you have ruined my oven’ which is a ludicrous statement as we have been nothing but respectful guests. My partner and I have used Airbnb many times all around the world while traveling and have never had an experience like this one. This was our experience and from this I would highly recommend finding another accommodation. It is extremely overpriced for what it is and unless you like to be bothered by a host on multiple occasions everyday I would stay well away. I take full responsibility for perhaps not reading the rules about perfumed products more clearly and not contacting Wendy before arrival however this was not the main problem for us. The invasion of privacy and being approached so often while in a private room that we payed a lot of money for was the main problem. If you are looking for a pleasant stay in Bristol I would recommend elsewhere for a more enjoyable stay.

Excellent and Memorable stay. Loved and will cherish each and every moment spent in the house with Sue and Toby. They are superb hosts, very friendly, helpful, warm, accommodating, and very sweet. Sue and Toby made every minute special for us : the welcome drink, map to guide us to the near by places, the movies collection, speed of wi-fi , breakfast, the paintings collection and everything.. The room was sweetly decorated and very very clean :) I highly recommend the stay at the beautiful Georgian house with Sue and Toby.

Made very welcome by Sue and Toby in their lovely home. The room was spotlessly clean and very private (on the top floor) with its own ensuite shower. We had a mini fridge with fresh milk (more than can be said of most hotels) as well as tea and coffee making facilities.  Montpelier is a fun vibrant part of Bristol with some fabulous eateries nearby. Sue recommended Bell's Diner which was a 5 minute walk away and fabulous. We met up with family so had breakfast at the Old Bristolian, also very nearby. This was our first airbnb experience and a very positive one. Definitely would recommend to others.

We stayed for two nights in August 2013. The description of the accommodation was very accurate, a beautiful,light airy room with views over Bristol. We had everything we needed in the room, including a variety of teas, coffee, fresh milk and some scrummy biscuits! The house was delightfully furnished and breakfast was superb.Sue and Toby were marvellous hosts and were helpful in talking through our proposals re city visit. Sue made some excellent suggestions re local restaurants.A secure area for parking at the rear of the house was an asset in the city, we didn't use the car as everything was in easy reach.We would have no hesitation in visiting again!

Sue and Toby are the most perfect hosts. We were very touched by there generous spirits and there welcoming us into there home. Everything about our stay was perfect and we will remember it for a long time.The room was lovely, very comfortable and clean with a fabulous breakfast to send us on our way in the morning. We cannot reccomend a stay at 118 enough.Thanks again for making our visit to Bristol so special.Much Love Ali and Ju X X X

Had a fantastic stay.  Room spacious and totally private. Sue's breakfasts a legend and her artistic ability to present fruit a total delight... always a surprise to behold. Loved the personally designed notes and decor in the rooms too. Our daughter was ill during our stay and Sue looked after her like her own:)  Thank you Sue  Would definitely stay again - in fact I'm sure our kids will be back.

Sue and Toby were the perfect hosts. They were extremely welcoming and kind and even went as far as collecting us from the train station. The room itself (unpictured - we stayed in the second bedroom) was beautifully decorated.

Sue and Toby have a beautiful home which I was lucky enough to stay in for two nights.  Toby kindly came and got me from the station.  They are both fascinating people and went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable.  The room was very comfortable, with little touches such as fresh milk to make it feel like a real home from home.  The breakfasts were superb and nothing seemed like too much trouble. Would certainly stay here again.  Many thanks!

Our stay at Sue and Toby's was just lovely. Sue was the perfect host, making us feel right at home; super friendly but also very respectful of our privacy. She was so helpful and made us an amazing cooked breakfast the next morning. She was very patient with us, as we were a little late leaving and so very accommodating. We would definitely stay here again - Thank you so much Sue!!xx

Sue & Toby were very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble including parking at the rear through those narrow gates!  The room was excellent and cosy and the roofs not too sloping for a tall one like me.  The house decoration was very interesting and stimulating, and the entire block of Georgian terraces architecturally fascinating, surrounded as it is by houses of all eras. A historic part of Bristol to stay in.  Overall highly recommended, unless you have a Chelsea tractor!

We booked to stay 1 night with Sue and Toby, and they were fantastic - we arrived to a warm welcome and, after a lovely chat during which we were given top tips for the area and things to do in Bristol, were shown to a very comfortable, luxurious room with en suite.We had a lovely stay, unfortunately cut short as we had to return home early in the morning but would have loved to stay longer. Many thanks Toby and Sue!

What a wonderful weekend we had staying at Toby and Sue's house! Couldn't wish for kinder, more accommodating and friendly hosts. The house was a lovely eclectic mix of treasures and our room was completely private and comfy. We went to some great restaurants and bars in the area and loved its arty vibe - Toby and Sue will happily let you pick their brains for places to go. Basically these guys are awesome and we would highly recommend staying here. Hope to see you soon! Giuliana and Will xxx

This was our first airbnb and Bristol experience and I'm glad to say we thoroughly enjoyed it. Not knowing the different areas of the city we plumped for somewhere that looked fairly central and thought that a Georgian terrace sounded smart. Montpellier is approx. a 15 min walk to The U o B and reminded us ex Londoners a little bit of Brixton crossed with Stoke Newington with a touch of Hackney, which was fun. The house was a wonderful mix of shabby chic. A beautifully decorated home from home. A few cracks here and there but scrupulously clean and warm with very comfortable beds and lots of hot water for baths and showers. Also, very quiet at night. Our host Toby was relaxed, friendly and helpful without being intrusive. He produced a lovely continental breakfast for us consisting of cereal, toast, muffins and plenty of juice, tea and coffee. Thank you! We loved staying here and hope to come back. Can highly recommend Bel's Diner near by too!! Thanks Toby and looking forward to meeting you next time Sue.Lottie, Mick and Charlie.

We stayed in Sue and Toby's beautiful and cosy home for 6 nights. Unfortunately wee never had a chance to meet Sue, as she was away, but we really admired her art all around the house. Toby took wonderful care of us, from meeting us at the airport (it is a service Sue and Toby offer - it is 20% cheaper than the airport taxi and worked perfectly for us) to serving us wonderful and very elegantly presented breakfasts every morning to helping us find our way around Bristol, to giving us a ride to the station when he could. He was a wonderful host, very friendly and really helpful and responsible. One day when he was not there he arranged for a friend to take care of us and that was a great help too. We would wholeheartedly recommend the place and are already thinking of going back. Thank you very much Toby! Svetlana and Emilie

Sue & Toby—the consummate hosts! After a long day of touring around Bristol, it was lovely to "come home" to our AirBnB accommodation in the heart of it all. Toby and Sue greeted us warmly, made us feel at home, and made sure we had everything we needed. Then it was off to the perfect restaurant for us because Sue had read our profile and knew our cuisine preference. Thank you both for your hospitality!
</title>

<title>
Sue and Toby were great host. I actually have to say that this was the best Airbnb experience we have ever had (and we have always had good experiences). We arrived late at night. Sue had left the keys for us in a hidden place. Because Sue didn’t hear from me due to my mobile phone battery being dead she rushed home from a party to ensure we were able to access the house. It also happened to be my partners 30th birthday. We arrived to chocolate, wine and a card. The place is great! It reminded me of a bed and breakfast. Sue and Toby are not just great host but are really nice people with a beautiful house in a great area in Bristol. Obviously, I highly recommend!

Our first time in Bristol and a very warm welcome from Sue and Toby on our arrival - we had a lovely stay in this beautiful house - our room was quiet and we both slept very well, little thoughtful touches really added sparkle to the stay. The location is perfect, a few minutes walk to explore Stokes Croft and its cafes and eating places and spy the street art as you go, we will be recommending this place to family and friends.

Sue and Toby are really warm, friendly people. We were welcomed into their home  and Sue gave us lots of tips re going out in Bristol.

Such friendly pre-arrival communication before we arrived and a lovely welcome on arrival. The location is perfect for easy walking into central Bristol through the fascinating - & very artistically decoratedtagged! - neighbourhood of St.Paul's. House filled with lovely artwork & room comfortable & quiet. We did not meet Toby but Sue could not have been more helpful in directing us to where we needed to go. We would definitely stay here again.

We spent two nights in Sue and Toby's house in the top floor ensuite room which was perfect for our needs. We did not meet Toby but Sue was very warm and friendly and the perfect hostess from the moment she opened her door to us. The room was clean cosy and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay very much. I loved Sue's and other artworks on display around the house and she provided two nicely cooked full English breakfasts. We would certainly like to stay there again.

Lovely house, great area, really enjoyed Montpelier, Bells Diner, The Bristolian, Stokes Croft etc.Sue and Toby were really lovely, welcoming us into their home, they and their hospitality helped make our weekend a real joy. It was fab to meet them and stay at their great place. We will be back.

Lovely house in a great location I stayed in the top floor which was private, quiet and I enjoyed having en-suite facilities. The whole house is decorated to a very high standard with unique and interesting furnishings. The top floor was newly re-decorated. Sue was welcoming and very accommodating to my needs and kept in touch the whole time. I was very busy in Bristol and didn't get a chance to see much of Sue and Toby, I would love to stay in their house again.

We found Sue and Toby very helpful. We booked up at very short notice and arrangements were made very quickly. We stayed in the attic room  with ensuite; which  was very pleasent. Very good experience we could not fault anything and hopefully we will visit again.

Sue and Toby are both excellent hosts, friendly and very obliging. Sue drove us on arrival and departure to and from airport avoiding transport hassles. Local knowledge of places to eat etc. very useful. Our room was very comfortable and the garden great to relax in. Walk to the city centre was easy also local bus and train were handy. We stayed a week and had a lovely holiday. If returning to Bristol ( a beautiful city) we would stay with Sue and Toby again.

Be careful with this accommodation! These people have 2 rooms advertised on Airbn, but in fact they have just one! This one is a huge, bright and beautiful room, king size bed, with a large, bright bathroom too. The second one is three times smaller, called "suite" room top, sloping ceiling, with a separate bathroom with a curtain (no door). Both rooms at the same price!!!. When you have already booked (and paid), they start telling you that they have had some problems with the big one (leaks, works, ...) but that there is no problem as they have another one on the top (have a look at other peoples' evalutions) . Usually it seems that people do not complain,  so you will stay at the much more smaller room at the price of the big one. By the way the big one is their own bedroom!The neighborhood is not in the center and does not look at all secure.

Sue and Toby were lovely! I only met Toby the once but he was nice and sue was such a lovely lady. She made me feel so welcomed and helped me feel at home when I was working away, she even bought me a gin and tonic up to my room, which was kind beyond expectation! I'm already booked in to stay again...and the bed is so comfortable, I had a great week of sleep! Lovely private bathroom and never an issue to park x

A very enjoyable stay! Lovely house full of interesting stuff and Sue and Toby made us feel very welcome. We were out and about for most of our brief stay but the house and the room were so nice to come back to. Ideal location too so we will most definitely be back!

What a cool area to stay in. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Comfortable bed, in a lovely old town house. Bristol is where it's at and Sue was very helpful,  but definitely gave us privacy. Loved the tea and biscuits. Would love to stay again if coming to bristol in the future.

I stayed with Sue just last night for my little foray into Bristol in the midst of the London leg of my European tour. She's a wonderful host with a beautiful home. With its vegan shops, omnipresent art, and connoisseur's cafes, Montpelier is enchanting. Highly recommended home and town for any traveler.

We had a wonderful weekend in Sue and Toby's house in Bristol. They are an absolutely lovely couple, we felt welcomed from the first second.

Had a comfortable stay with 2 friends at Toby and Sue's place at Bristol. They were very accommodating and provided our needs. Due to our plans in Bath we couldn't meet in person however they helped us immensely through our phone conversations. Their place is a walking distance from the city centre, totally recommend this place to other globetrotters.

Staying at Sue and Toby's was great. Its such a lovely place in a fantastic and convenient part of the city. We were there for a weekend and it was easy to just stroll into the city centre without any hassle. As hosts, Sue and Toby could not have made us feel more at home! We were a little loud on one of the nights and there was another couple staying, so if theres a negative review on here because on one night it might've been slightly 'noisy', it was entirely our fault! (Sue did ask us to be considerate in advance in all fairness). All in all, if you're heading to Bristol this is a beautiful place to stay, everything was delightful. Thank you Sue & Toby!

Sue's house is in a great location in Bristol-close to lively Stokes Croft and Montpelier so good for shops and cafesrestaurants. Sue is very friendly and welcoming and was easy to communicate with prior to arriving and during our stay.   The room we stayed in is elegantly furnished with a huge comfortable bed.  Bathroom is on the same floor and equipped with toiletries.  Sue has thought of everything to make guests feel welcome and her home has a lovely feel with beautiful original artworks and photgraphs.  Would recommend staying here.

What a lovely place to stay!  The room is beautiful and the area is so quiet.  I could have spent hours looking at all the artwork on the walls.  It is a beautiful period house.Sue made me feel very welcome and was very accommodating with my tricky work hours which could have made my check-in difficult.  She recommended a fantastic local restaurant.  This place would be perfect for a holiday get away.

<title>
It's hard to put into words how blown away me and my fiancé were by Sue and Toby's  hospitality. They are the meaning of "extra mile". Their house was like something out of a beautiful movie, our apartment couldn't have been more perfect and their kindness, generosity, and thought for us as guests, I think can never be matched. There for, all future trips of ours to Bristol will be based around the availability of Sue and Toby who I can safely say have become our new lovely friends.

Sue was the perfect hostess. She was relaxed and welcoming, there when we needed her and gave us some great tips. The 2 places she recommended to eat, the Thali and the Bristolian, were both excellent and will be firm favourites when in Bristol. She also respected our privacy intuitively. The house is beautiful, lovely art on the walls. Thank you Sue and Toby for sharing your home with us. Couldn't have asked for anything better.

8 of us stayed at Samantha's beautiful house and had an absolutely fantastic time. From the moment we arrived to when we left this magical place, we were treated as treasured guests. The perfect host, Samantha made us feel like royalty. Everything was perfect; fresh linen and towels, gifts to greet us, immaculately clean house, tips on where to go and to eat. The house has unique and exciting artwork with interesting nooks. The open fire and multitude of candles created a sense of inner warmth that will relax and inspire any guest. The garden is beautiful and the perfect escape from the bustle of Bristol city.The location was perfect for us and is near the city centre and right beside Bristol's exciting monpelier and stokes croft. Brilliant for exploring the area!It was so much more than just a place to stay: Samantha (and the duchess) made our stay special. Samantha couldn't do enough for us and I cannot imagine anyone having anything less than a wonderful experience.I cannot recommend staying here enough to do the time we had justice. You will love the house, you will feel extremely welcome and you will get the best of Bristol.I can honestly say this is one of the best places I have ever stayed!
</title>

<document id="337">
<title>
Samantha was the perfect hostess, going above and beyond to make sure our stay was unforgettable and I would thoroughly recommend anyone to visit. The house was magical, kooky and highly unique, and Samantha's finishing touches such as freshly baked banana bread when we arrived and pink fizz in the fridge made us feel hugely valued and looked after. Samantha helped make our trip all the more easy by booking us taxi's and so on - even coming to the rescue with some jump leads in the morning when our car wouldn't start! We can't wait to book another trip and my advice is that the house and Samantha have to be experienced to be believed - don't miss out!
</title>

We stayed in Samatha's beautiful house for a hen weekend and loved every minute of it. Lots of fun and unusual things to explore, and an amazing space which made our stay really special. The garden is also lovely and the perfect haven to escape to. Samantha was the perfect host and we loved having the Duchess around too! The house is in a great location- very close to everything and a good base to explore Bristol. Would highly recommend staying here!

We had the best weekend ever in Samantha's house - she could not have been any more lovely and welcoming. Her house is an absolute treasure and you are made to feel so welcome with Samantha's little touches. It's in a great location and has everything you could ever need. 7 of us plus a baby stayed at the house and had the most fun. This is a brilliant party house and you will talk and smile about it for years. The only bad thing was having to hand the keys back...we'll be back again soon! 
</title>
</document>
<document id="340">
<title>
Samantha's house is a gem of a place in the heart of boho Bristol. It is on a quiet and pretty street but within a minute's walk of top notch restaurants, cafes and shops. As the pictures show, the house is filled with an eclectic mix of art and antiques and the overall effect is a genuine delight.  Although I didn't get the meet Sam (my fault), she was very warm and helpful in her communication and I can tell she is a generous and thoughtful person. I hope I can make it back again!

We needed a special place not too far from London for our reunion of pals and were captivated by Samantha's description and pictures of this truly magical place, this little slice of heaven in Bristol. The location was perfect for walking into town to see the best concentration of public art anywhere or, conversely,  down to the harbour for a lovely stroll among the shops and galleries., The Montpelier cafes, pubs and shops near the house are also wonderfully unique. Best of all, Samantha, who is the world's warmest host, and greatest collector of beautiful objects made sure the home was warm, welcoming and accommodating and I can't imagine anyone with a bigger heart or a more gracious spirit. She made us truly feel welcome and at home, from the generous supply of candles and special gifts, through to her infectious smile and happy spirit. This home is a truly magical place to stay. We loved it and keen to return. This is a fabulous place for a big group (there were 10 of us including 2 little 'uns) - it was the perfect place to see in the New Year. So cosy, and we'd love to see it in summer too, as the garden is so beautiful. All in all, perfectly magical and Samantha went out of her way to welcome us. Feeling loved-up and inspired! 'twas truly hard to leave!If you go to Bristol and want to know it from a local perspective, make sure you see Samantha and meet her cat Duchess and stay in the best BnB this side of the Channel.

We stayed in Samantha's beautiful house for a hen weekend. There were 10 of us and we had a fantastic experience! The house was spacious and there was plenty of room for all of us and lots of crockery, cutlery, glasses etc. which made the mass catering a lot easier! We were lucky with the weather and the garden was a fantastic spot to relax and enjoy the sunshine. Also, there were a multitude of hats, costumes etc. which we loved dressing up in and which made an amazing addition to the weekend! Samantha was very friendly and helpful and the wine and fizz on arrival was an incredibly welcome touch.I would highly recommend Samantha's house for a memorable group stay with a bit of a difference - it was absolutely ideal for our weekend and we all had a fantastic time!

I booked Samantha's amazing quirky house for my sister's hen night, 13 girls stayed there and every one of us loved it. The house is beautiful, comfortable, well appointed and full of interesting objects and knick knacks. We hadn't planned on going out at all during the stay and I'm glad as it gave us more time in the house. I was a bit worried about the kitchen as I thought there may not be enough glassware and crockery for all of us but there's plenty, as well as lovely Victorian tea sets and cake stands which we used when we had tea and cake and it made it feel very special. All the beds are very comfortable, even the sofa bed and the pull out bed, every one of us slept well. What really made it extra special for us though was the incredible selection of amazing fancy dress costumes in every wardrobe. We all dressed up both nights and had so much fun doing so, it really was an added bonus that I hadn't counted on!We didn't really use the garden as the weather was a bit miserable but it looked lovely, I'd like to come back when it's a bit sunnier!Otherwise the house is situated in a great area, with lots of shops and cash points and other things you may need close by however you really can't tell when you're inside as it's lovely and quiet and peaceful.I would most definitely recommend this house, especially for a girly weekendholiday or a hen party!

We had a lovely time in this fun and quirky house – which certainly provided a talking point for the hen weekend. It was like a treasure trove, around every corner there was something new and wonderful to discover and talk about. We were greeted with a friendly welcome and given the tour – which was very useful . The charming house met all our needs and was very comfortable. It was exactly as described and pictured in the listing so we were not disappointed. I would definitely recommend the house! The owner was friendly. She had great communication skills and answered all our questions about the area quickly – recommending restaurants, taxi numbers and bars. And even returned a pair of flip flops that were left behind!

Nestled within the arty, Bohemian Montpelier district in Bristol lies Honeybottom - official name of this quirky, beautifully bonkers abode, that welcomes you with open arms (and champagne & chocolates!) from the moment you walk through it's bright red door.We arrived on a mild June evening and, after the tour of the eclectic but spotlessly clean rooms, ventured out into the candlelit, fairytale garden and supped wine under the stars surrounded by tea lights. Magical indeed!And our weekend only got better from there. All guests slept like babies in their amazingly comfortable beds. The sun shone through into the living room the next day and it was hard to prise ourselves away, either off the bohemith of a sofa or from the tranquility of the gorgeous garden! But when we did venture out, it was super easy to walk into the centre of town, through the great cafes, bars, thrift shops and street art in the local area.This house has a laid back charm that instantly makes you feel at home.We wanted a cosy, home from home, with a tonne of character, where we could all be together, relax and do exactly whatever we felt like doing, and that is exactly what we got. Everyone should experience the wonders of the unique and very special Honeybottom for themselves. Highly recommend.

The house was INCREDIBLE! We had a hen party of 11 people. We loved the eclectic interiors, vintage wall paper, every room themed and named with amazing dress up in the wardrobes. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was fully equipped with everything you needed. We had lovely weather so got to enjoy the garden in the sun. The location was brilliant, easy walk into town, quick and cheap taxi ride and Montpelier was great for cafe's and cute vintage stores. We had a fab dinner at the Bells diner which was seconds from the house. Highly recommend this house to anyone in a large group who likes a bit of quirk!
</title>

<document id="349">
<title>
We invited our daughter's friends to join us at Honeybottom for her 21st birthday celebrations, without telling them anything about the house in advance. They were, of course, astonished and delighted when they arrived, and all of them loved it. The icing on the cake was when they discovered the dressing-up clothes - costume changes between courses during dinner made the evening feel even more fun, surreal and unforgettable. The house was beautifully warm, even in February, and the beds comfortable.Samantha couldn't have been more friendly and helpful communicating with us, and although we didn't meet her, we were given a warm welcome at the house by Sean, who was great too.

Samantha is a great host - she allowed us early arrival and answered all our pre-arrival questions promptly and fully. The house is well stocked and comfortable, including a lovely bottle of champagne and Neal's Yard toiletries! The house worked ok with young children but with so many trinkets etc this can be a bit hazardous. Parking was a slight issue as we sometimes had to park a few streets away but this wouldn't be an issue if you weren't always using the car and the location is great for walking into town. The garden is lovely - although the steps are a bit large and with a pond, albeit small, the children couldn't play unsupervised. I would definitely return with a group of friends, or when children are older, but probably not with small children again! on the other hand our 2 year old loves the fairy wings Samantha generously gave her!

Wonderful, just wonderful.  Montpelier did not disappoint and the house was more than we could have imagined.  We were lucky enough to be able to enjoy the garden which is such a suntrap.  We were a gaggle of 13 hens and didn't have to travel far for cocktails and dancing on neighbouring Gloucester Road.  Sean showed us around on arrival and he was most helpful.  The house really was the perfect retreat for us.

What a wonderful house!! Eclectic, eccentric yet very homey. The kitchen is generously stocked and bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean. The sheets and pillows were fabulous - we all slept very comfortably. The garden is also looking superb at this time of year (end of May) with roses everywhere. Highly recommend, 5 star!

This place is so good for party and bunch of group staying in. You can get everything you want for your party. Haha.Besides, the location is good as well. You can have your breakfast just minute walk to bristolian cafe. Which recommended for breakfast and also just 15mins walk to center. I haven't meet Samantha during my stay, but I met Sean, he is a nice guy. No problem with communication as well. Everything is good in the house, even the cleanness. This is out of my aspect.

The house was fantastic and exactly as described.  We had a great time trying on all the amazing clothes and hats and loved sitting out in the garden when the sun came out.  The kitchen was well equipped and the beds were insanely comfortable!  It was a brilliant location.  Just wish we could have stayed longer as a weekend was not enough time to explore Bristol.

It was indeed MAGICAL - what an awesome house ooozing love and happiness with its beautifully crafted interior.  Could not have asked for more.  Bristol treated us to a spectacular display of rain, rain and more rain but it didn't matter as we had each other and this cosy, 'sunny' house to keep us warm and dry - not to mention entertained : ) Thank you so much Samantha and Sean for your help and for giving us a truly memorable trip with friends gathered from the 4 corners - a great way to welcome 2016.  The kids all loved it too and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.

The house is original, unique, perfectly equipped and with personality beyond your wildest dream.  If you are looking for a magical place to stay with the right balance of eccentricity, space and fun, then this fits the bill.  Clearly an enormous amount of work had been put in to get the house to its marvelous condition, and Samantha and team need to be applauded.  Very easy and straightforward to work with, and an absolute pleasure.

We had a great experience in Samantha's house. We booked the house for a week as we were working in Bristol for a few days and were very glad we were staying there. After a long day at work, it was great to relax in such a beautiful house. It's really central, yet on a quiet street with a beautiful garden. Prior to our arrival communication with Samantha was easy and smooth, our arrival was super easy. We'd definitely go back there if we need to go back to Bristol again.

This place is out of this world. Fantastically equipped, enchanting, big, full of interesting stuff. Our huge group with lots of kids had an amazing time.

A great house which is as described. Really quirky and it is a great location Montpellier has some great bars and not far from town. Samantha was always quick to respond and we were met by her cleaner who showed us around. The kitchen was big enough for us to cook a meal for 11 and the outside garden was great for sitting in the sun having a meal. Highly recommended.

We booked Samantha’s house for a hen weekend for 12 people. The house was perfect for our needs. It’s roomy and perfectly located. The house is pretty quirky which also adds to the fun of a hen weekend. It also has a wonderful garden which got good use. I can’t speak for all of the beds, but unfortunately mine was pretty uncomfortable, two very soft mattresses on top of each other. They are also not the biggest beds I’ve slept in, pretty cosy if you’re sharing with someone other than your partner! But really, who goes on a hen weekend to sleep? The house is on a quiet road so no traffic noise which was good. All in all, we had an excellent stay. The house is in a great location and is well stocked. Thanks for your hospitality.

There are not enough nice things we could say about this home and Samantha. From the very beginning she had been Incredibly warm and welcoming. She has been there to answer ALL of our questions and made the check-in process quite easy and very enjoyable!! She did an amazing job preparing the house for our stay and everything thing about it was so charming! The house is quite large with the most gorgeously decorated rooms, and amazing bathrooms. Samantha has put a lot of care and love into this house and it shows from the second you walk in the door. The garden out back was truly magical and made the perfect environment to sit catch up with friends and family from afar. The Montpelier area is very unique and Samantha's home nestles in there quite perfectly. I cannot recommend this home enough to those traveling to Bristol, as well as residents of Bristol! Samantha and her home were just perfect! Absolutely 5+ stars!

Located in Montpelier the property is well situated to explore the more central and bohemian parts of Bristol. The internal decor is stylish, but very quirky and playful - something that will appeal to many but to be taken into consideration if that is not what you are looking for. Size wise the property is on the small side for a five bedroom property. We fitted 5 people around the dining table in the kitchen for dinner but many more would be a little cramped. The host was very helpful, responding quickly to my questions, providing useful local recommendations and guiding me through my first experience of booking an airbnb. Being a central location parking is very restricted in the local area.

Samantha’s home is quirky and totally individual. It is really well placed in a quiet residential area but 5 minutes walk from great restaurants, bars and night life. The house has a beautiful garden and is well equipped in the kitchen and with plenty of bathrooms for our large party of 14. As with all older houses it’s a little creaky so earplugs are good if you are going to be getting up and going to bed at different times...Samantha was super friendly and very accommodating of our flexible checkin in and out requests.thanks Samantha for a great weekend.

As a hen party of 11 ladies, we absolutely loved our weekend stay at Samantha’s stunning home! Samantha was the most welcoming and accommodating host, making us feel incredibly welcome. Samantha’s home is something not to be missed, the eclectic interior is amazing and will not be forgotten ! Samantha’s home had everything we could ask for and more. The kitchen was very well stocked and the power showers were brilliant. The beds were very comfortable and the living space was perfect for dancing the night away. We had an amazing weekend at Samantha’s home and cannot thank her enough for letting us stay !

This house made our whole trip to Bristol. Unfortunately our plans in Bristol were a bit scuppered due to it being early corona days and we felt we should stay in to be responsible. But this amazing house made staying indoors an experience in itself. It’s quirky decor and unique touches were beautiful. Sam meeting us and giving us a tour and explaining that the house is to be loved and lived in, so to explore it all weekend, was really kind and made us feel at home. Really helpful info about the town and where to go for drinks etc. Great communication and totally understanding with changesarrival times etc. Great showers!! I would recommend this house and totally stay here again. I loved it. Thank you Sam xxx

Staying at Cathy's sunny room was a pleasure, she's a very kind person and she's also pretty cool so we had three perfectly easy going days in Bristol.From her house you can walk down to the city centre, a nice walkway goes through the trees.

Plus a very welcoming and lovely family, who  look after their guest with great care.  I had to you to Bristol with one over night stay for a work meeting and could not have found a better place to stay to arrive the next morning rested and happy.Thank you.

Sonia was extremely helpful in accommodating us at the last minute. The house is lovely and the loft room is very comfortable and private. There was tea and coffee in the room as well as breakfast provided - recommended!

I've visited Bristol over the weekend with my partner. It’s been our first visit and we were very excited to explore the city.I can’t imagine a better starting point than Sonia’s place! Sonia & Chris gave us so many invaluable tips! We've managed to see loads of gems that wouldn't be discovered without insiders help. We didn't even have to go far on the first day, there was so much to explore in the Bishopston area. All these independent cafes and small shops kept us busy throughout the day. The location was also perfect for the further exploration. The room itself was great as well. Yummy breakfast and great atmosphere in the house made it a perfect place to stay! Thanks guys!Anna & Wojtek

Staying with Sonia and her family in Bristol was delightful!They are located just off Gloucester Road - a vibrant community of independent shops and great cafes and restaurants - an easy walk (well bus ride in the rain!) to the centre of Bristol.The house is a beautifully comfortable family home and we stayed in the attic room with en-suite - a little bit away from the bustle of the rest of the house.Breakfast was great - a buffet of coffee, tea, juice, toast, cereal and yoghurt all laid out in the beautiful kitchen.Sonia and her husband couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming - giving us tips on where to eat (my partner met up with long-lost friends at the local Buddhist Centre cafe - she used to live in their previous building in Somerset!)The house has cool decoration and is warm and cosy. Sonia's kids are gorgeous and made sure we were welcomed into their home.If you want to learn Italian there are even signs up in both English and Italian to help you improve your vocabulary of everyday household objects. (Sonia is Italian and her husband is Irish - I think the kids are becoming bilingual!)We will definitely be back next time we are in Bristol - thank you :-)

My 2 year old son and I had a lovely stay at Sonia's house with her family. The room was cosy, warm and spotless and each morning we came down to a lovely breakfast. Sonia and her family were very warm and welcoming and we felt very at home. We'd stay again!

Cute and colorful place in a great location that makes for easy walkingbus access to most of Bristol. The room is very comfortable and gives you the option to be left alone if you so choose. Sonia and Chris are very warm and welcoming and this is overall a great place to stay.

Sonia and Chris are wonderful, thoughtful hosts. We had a lovely time in their house, delicious breakfast (great bread!), and a delightful room experience - cozy, private, with all the amenities needed. We would definitely recommend, and come back!

Sonia, Chris and their lovely children were so welcoming and made us feel at home. Their house is lovely and comfortable, and the self service breakfast was great too. Very conveniently located for all of Gloucester roads gorgeous boutique shops, bars and restaurants. We would definitely stay again, in fact we didn't want to leave.

We contacted Sonia and Chris at very short notice and had a wonderful night at their place before returning home from our vacations. Although Sonia was on vacation she got back to me right away, Chris was a great host and the area where they live is lovely. Thank you!

We had a lovely stay at colourful Chris and Sonia's house and would strongly recommend their place. We have especially appreciated their flexible attitude as our arrival was delayed due to the travel arrangements and were even given an option of a late breakfast!The room had everything we needed and although we didn't get to meet Sonia and kids who happened to be on holiday, Chris was a brilliant host with a great knowledge of Bristol that has made our short stay worthwhile.  
</title>
</document>
<document id="434">
<title>
I had a brief stay at short notice at Sonia and Chris' beautiful home.  Sonia was very quick replying to messages despite being away, and Chris was very welcoming, making my stay comfortable and giving advice on where to find restaurants etc close by. If I ever need to stay in the Bristol area again I'd happily return.

We were a bit shocked because this room is really small. I think it is too small for two persons. The bathroom is directly connected (no real door between room and bathroom) and it is the smallest I have ever seen. The basin is very low and extremely small. Might have been installed for a child.Sonia was very friendly to us, her husband was not really polite. We used the TV in the evening, and the next day he was like "You were too loud, you woke the baby". Another day later they refused the breakfast with the comment "There are many nice cafes in the area".Most of the fotos here show rooms of the house but not the rooms you can use. We were only invited to use one end of the kitchen table. The rest seemed private to us. That's okay, but it's not okay to show all these rooms on the photos connected to this offer.

Great to stay with a lovely friendly family, made me feel at home straight away. Nice quiet street and very close to the shops and cafe's in Bristol's famous Gloucester Road. The room was a nice size, bed comfortable and it felt a luxury to have tea and coffee in the room and my own shower and loo. Sonia was kind enough to recommend a walk to the nature reserve, alotments and City Farm, which I might have missed otherwise, all-in-all a great airbnb experience.

Although just for one night, we really enjoyed staying at Sonia's! The room is very cosy and warm and the ensuite extremely convenient.

I have stayed at Sonia's place for a weekend and it was absolutely awesome! Such a welcoming family, beautiful rooms and in quite an exciting area, close to Gloucester Street and Stokes Croft. Breakfast is provided and is a dream! I would highly recommend this airbnb!

I stayed with Sonia and her family for 4 nights while working in Bristol and they were great. The place is nice and the family are friendly!  The good:- Sonia and her husband are really friendly, as are the kids.- The breakfast is varied and delicious (museli and toast etc..)- Ensuite and in-room television are very good- Great location for Glouchester roadNot as good:- No use of kitchen at all. My mistake for not reading the house rules, but not being able to even microwave soup or something similar makes it much less of a 'home away from home' and is enough that I could not book there again (otherwise why not take a hotel?).- The bed is not very comfortable. The mattress is thin so you can feel the wooden slats through it. It is not the worst mattress I've had, but not great either.

Staying at Sonia and Chris was absolutely lovely. I felt welcome and relaxed while the lively family brighten up the mornings as we all met in the lovely kitchen for breakfast.The house is clean and the smell of clean laundry punctuates that as one enters the room.I would highly recommend Sonia's place to anybody who wants a good place to stay and a good company to enjoy.Thanks Sonia and Chris (and Giorgio, Maya and Cia)Valeria

Our experience was quite nice. The bedroom had tea service set up in it. The ensuite was quite nice and the shower was great. Sonia's husband is an intresting conversationalist. If he had not told us about the awsome suspension bridge in Bristol we would have missed checking it out.

We really enjoyed staying with Sonia and Chris.  They were so helpful and friendly, and made us feel very at home.  Chris had some excellent recommendations for places to eat near their house.  The room was light and airy, with a very powerful shower. The breakfast was delicious, eaten in the kitchen with the French doors open and the sun streaming in.  Go there!

<title>
Friendly and considerate welcome.  Room as described - spotlessly clean and nice and light.  Bed was comfy for us: the mattress is hard as you would expect with this type of bed. Great shower. Good choice of teas, plus coffee. As the only room on the top floor of the house it feels private.      It is not always easy to find a parking space in Bristol: the on-street parking is manageable here and we found a place two doors down.

Unfortunately we could spend only one weekend in Bristol, so we just needed a room for one night, but this one night at Sonia's place was perfect, I think Sonia and Chris are very nice and friendly people, they know the area very well, also the room was comfortable, spotless clean, and nice. It was my first time having a room with Airbnb, and it was such a nice start. Thanks Sonia & Chris!

I had a lovely time staying with Sonia, Chris and their kids. Although i was writing my thesis all the day, i feel very happy when i hear kids playing.

The family were all welcoming and hospitable including the lovely children. The room was private with an en suite and there was tea and coffee set out on a sweet little tray with kettle, cup and water pitcher. It all suited my needs perfectly as I was on a weekend yoga course within easy walking distance off the Gloucester Road. Breakfast was perfect and I enjoyed sitting with the family and having a variety of good cereals, toast and drinks on offer. I even got a fresh croissant one morning! All my needs were met and I felt if I lived closer, the hosts could be friends, they were so nice and friendly.

I booked the room at Sonia's home for my mum and her friend who came to visit us for a week. They (and we) received a warm welcome from Sonia and her family. What adorable children! It was the first time that my mum was using airbnb so she was a bit surprised at first about the fact that you actually stay in people's home. But it did add a positive touch to her experience. As the weather got colder, my mum and her friend did feel a bit cold in the room. When I mentioned it to Sonia, she quickly resolved the issue and switched the heating on for them. In terms of comfort, bearing in mind that my mum and her friend are both over 60, they did find it a bit difficult to sleep on (and get up from) low beds.  For breakfast, they were happy with the wide choice on offer and particularly enjoyed trying out new things like date syrup! :)Thank you Sonia for accommodating them!

We had a lovely stay with Chris and Sonia.  The room is ideal - right at the top of the house and very cosy, with an excellent en-suite.  We had a delicious breakfast and really enjoyed meeting the children who were as friendly as their parents.  Thank you for making us so welcome!

Sorry I am so late to share my experience. It was so nice to live in Sonia's home, she and her family are very warm and friendly, which is amazing to be there. The position is very easy to find, and the room is so clean and warm, they have everything you need! If I will go to Bristol again, I will choose this one again without hesitation

Lovely eclectic home, hosted by a lovely family and their 3 cats. The room was very clean, light and airy. Great location for those wanting to see the delights of Gloucester road.

I stayed in a lovely attic room with an ensuite bathroom; the house itself is about 2030 minutes walk from central Bristol (though there are plenty of busses running down the road nearby) and the local area was vibrant with lots of bars, cafes and places to eat.

Sonia and her family are lovely, interesting, warm-hearted people who made me feel very welcome in their colourful, light, clean and relaxed home. They were accommodating and easy-going, and provided a nice, quality breakfast, a homely room (with WiFi), and the shower was really good too. Tea facilities in the room was a nice surprise (and a good tea selection!). The house is well located for getting around Bristol and into the centre, and for restaurants and bars etc. Would definitely stay again!

Staying at Sonia and Chris' house was delightful! The room was exactly as described--spacious, cosy and clean. Their entire house is very warm and tastefully designed, making it very comfortable to settle in for a night. The neighbourhood is full of quirky cafes and shops, a vital part of the Bristol experience. After getting a great night's sleep, I woke up to the best breakfast I have ever been served at an Airbnb home--not your standard box of cereal! It was very clear from the start that Sonia and Chris put a lot of effort into ensuring that their guests have a great experience, and I continue to boast about their hospitality to this day!

Sonia and Chris were excellent hosts. I stayed with them while looking for permanent housing in Bristol and they were very helpful with tips about the city and ideas of places to go. They went above and beyond to make my stay a good one (and the fantastic breakfast was always a great start to the day!). The room was a great place to come back to after a busy day of exploring. I'd definitely recommend them!

Sonia and Chris were extremely welcoming, so much so that the house felt like a home away from home. The entire family are polite (especially the kids!) and respectful of the need for privacy.The room itself is very spacious, beautifully furnished and decorated (even with a printer and computer there ready for use!). The internet is fast, the bed comfy and the continental breakfast top notch!Overall, I cannot recommend more.

Sonia is an excellent host and extremely  welcoming.  The room meet all the travelle's needs, including wi fi and a small television.  The house is conveniently located close to the  Glouchester Road shopping precinct and is easily accessed by bus from the city.  From Temple Mead  Train Station a Number 11 bus and from the city centre, No 75 or 76.  Chris and Sonia made some excellent recommendations about touring, which only a local would know.

I really enjoyed my stay with Sonia & Chris and their family.  I was in Bristol for a course and consequently was out for most of the time but I was made to feel very welcome when there.  The house is in a quiet road and my room was clean, warm and comfortable.  Although the bathroom was shared with the family it was always empty when I wanted to use it.  Breakfast, shared with the family around the kitchen table was also delightful.  They even loaned me their Bristol AtoZ so that I could find the couse venue.  Great people, great stay.  Will definitely use again if I'm in Bristol.  Thanks.

What a wonderful house with wonderful people! 3040mins walk from the main train station (Temple Meads) and in the funky independent high street area of Gloucester Road. I would be so pleased to own such a lovely house like Sonia's one day ... spacious, colourful and just generally lovely. The attic double room was a good size, with a nice en-suite - all spotlessly clean. There was no faulting Sonia and Chris - happy to let me do my own thing and so very friendly. I would definitely recommend this to others.

The stay with Sonia and Chris in Bristol was great. They are a sociable couple with three young children.The location is great, being right alongside Gloucester Road and near Stokes Croft with great places to eat and drink and interesting street art and other things to be amongst.Home was very clean and warm and Sonia and Chris were very generous with the great breakfast they provide. I enjoyed my stay here in Bristol.

<title>
This was my first AirBnB experience and so I chose to stay with a host who has achieved a long run of successively good feedback. I can now add to that list of happy guests and can vouch that Sonia deserves all the praise that has been written up for her. They were gracious hosts and I had an enjoyable stay in the "spacious cosy room". It contains a comfortable single bed, plenty of storagehanging space for one guest, a window to the garden with a decent curtain, and a useful desk to do paperwork at if necessary. Sonia also provided a towel, flannel and slippers for my stay. She also kindly lent me her printer, which I really appreciated. Breakfast consisted of a choice of cereals, fruit juices, milk, bread, coffeetea and a selection of spreads. The bathroom is down the corridor and shared with the family but it was empty when I wanted to use it (peak time is around 88:30am for getting the children ready) and was always clean and tidy. The three young children are exemplary - they were exceptionally well-behaved. Overall, I would recommend Sonia's "spacious cost room" to any AirBnB user.

The room was very clean, the bed very comfortable, and the breakfast so sweet I imagined myself I was at home.There are many facilities, which made my staying very comfortable.

It was a nice room, and Sonia was great to get back to my text messages and emails for buses to get there.  I needed some privacy after trecking around Italy, and it was nice to have a nice bed with English TV in the room.   Wifi was good, and breakfast was great.  The area was nice too with some nice artsy shops on Gloucester rd. although it took me two days to pronounce it:)  There is also a nice Baptist church across the street which was one of my highlights.  I went and was so welcomed for a Sunday 10:30 am service.  It was really what I needed.. some friendly connection when so far from home.  Check it out if inclined since you will feel so welcomed there as well as at Sonia's.

Sonia and Chris and their wonderful children were the perfect hosts. I had a short tour of the house when I arrived (even though they were busy arranging their dinner) and Chris recommended a fantastic place to eat (Zazu's kitchen). I then came back and fell into a deep sleep so didn't manage to catch up with them all until morning. In the morning they had set out a great variety of breakfasts to choose from and I was made very welcome and had a pleasant chat with their daughter about holidays. Chris was also kind enough to let me keep my bag at the house as long as I needed on my last day, which was very helpful indeed. The room was good too and had a television and tea making facilities and a very handy binder of useful local information. Thank you very much Sonia and Chris and all your lovely children!

I only stayed for one night with Sonia and Chris and regreted not staying longer. Room and house were very cosy, tidy and clean and they've been soooo welcoming! Despite my low carb diet (so no bread and no muesli for breakfast) I was provided with a great breakfast. I can only recommend staying with Sonia and her lovely family.

Wonderful host and family! Sonia and Chris as well as their well behaved kids are very welcoming! Thanks so much for your hospitality. You surely made me feel home. I miss the breakfast too! You will get your own kettle and cups as well as TV in your room. Lots of restaurants nearby. Good transportation network with frequent buses going up to Gloucester Road and city centre. 15 min bus ride to town and if you walk, it takes you about 45 to 60 mins. Sonia and Chris, you are really wonderful parents. You have been teaching Maia, Georgio and Lucia so well. I will surely learn from you. Lucia is so lovely.

Sonia's house is a great place to stay. It was nice to meet the family at breakfast time and I was made to feel very welcome. The room is very comfortable and has a desk which is nice for those of us who have to take our work with us,

I spent a night at Sonia and Chris's home in the Cosy Room, and it was very pleasant. Chris was a very kind host and the children were very sweet indeed. It's a gorgeous house in a good part of town. Thank you!

I enjoyed staying at Sonia's airbnb. Nice house, lovely family and pretty guest room. And it's just a stone's throw away from Gloucester Road with all its shops and cafes. Recommended.

Welcoming and cute house, really well located. Don't hesitate to rent this room if you are alone and need to stay a couple of days in Bristol. Chris and Sonia are very pleasant hosts.

Brilliant family. Unique room. Wonderful home full of bots and bobs but mostly character!

<title>
I had a really nice stay with Chris and Sonia and their three little soldiers. They made me feel very welcome. The room was very clean with a spacious desk, plenty of hanging space and extra blankets for the bed. They were kind enough to invite me to their family breakfast, which was a nice touch. It's a far nicer experience than staying in an anonymous hotel. I will definitely stay there again when I am next in Bristol.
</title>
</document>
<document id="516">
<title>
Sonia and Chris are nice people and they form a lovely family with their three children. The room is really cosy, that was nice to stay there, their bathroom is really pleasant as well.They are very absorbed by their family life and it is sometimes difficult to socialize with them because of that.
</title>
</document>
<document id="517">
<title>
I had a lovely stay at Sonia's. It was incredibly spacious and comfortable and I was made to feel very welcome. I will most likely be returning to Bristol soon and will without doubt try to stay here again. Thank you once again!

Sonia and her family were warm and welcoming. The room (with en-suite) was clean, tidy and perfect for my needs.  If you're doing work in the evenings the side table is small but that is a very minor quibble when the overall package is so good.I was delighted with my stay.

 It was my second stay in Sonia's house and i enjoyed it as much as the first time.The room was very clean and comfortable and Sonia, Chris and their three kids are such a lovely family.Highly recommended !!!!

I absolutely loved staying here! Sonia and Chris are lovely and kind and the children are adorable and so polite. As soon as you walk in there is such a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. The room was fantastic, incredibly clean and the bed was comfy and cosy. Breakfast was just perfect. I actually didn't want to leave. The neighbourhood feels really safe and it was easy to park my car just outside. The location is great. I would stay here again without a second thought. Highly recommended!

I had a lovely stay with Sonia, Chris and the kids. Everyone was very welcoming and provided info and advice on bristol. They have a lovely house and this room is very spacious with a good single bed and desk. The breakfast is great and has options suitable for everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm back here again.
</title>

<title>
A warm welcome from Sonia and her family.  A cheerful, comfortable room in a family home.  A good choice of items for breakfast sometimes joining Sonia's delightful young children.  Lots of info about Bristol available in room if guests have time to explore.  The area also has a variety of places to eat if required.
</title>
</document>
<document id="524">
<title>
I had a pleasant stay in the cosy house of the Richardsons. The room's furniture is fine, comfortable and practical. I got a very rich breakfast and had some interesting conversation with Sonia and Chris. 
</title>
</document>
<document id="525">
<title>
This is a brilliant family home, very welcoming and ideal for visiting Bristol
</title>
</document>
<document id="526">
<title>
To my mind, the type of a visitor who would appreciate the "Spacious Cosy room" at Sonia's house is the following: it is a person who has no problems with hisher back, and she or he goes to bed early and gets up no later than at 7 a.m.. Also, this person should better like cereals for breakfast:) 
</title>

<document id="527">
<title>
Wonderful, inspiring, happy, clean family home in a brilliant area! Super convenient for bus stop and also an easy walk into town down vibrant Gloucester Rd. Such a treat to wake up to a spot set at the table and breakfast! Thanks for sharing your home with me for a couple of nights
</title>

<document id="528">
<title>
I stayed one night and received a friendly welcome and a simple breakfast. I appreciated being offered almond milk, as I don't take dairy products. The location was ideal and I was able to park in the  street. Wifi was available. The bed was basic but comfortable.This was my first experience of airbnb and I enjoyed the informality and friendliness of staying with a family. However I feel the cost is too high once the cleaning fee and the airbnb commission have been added. A hotel or guest house costs less, and is more flexible.

Excellent overnight stay. Comfortable room in a neat house surrounded by a busy and friendly family. If ever life takes me to Bristol again  I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Chez Sonia. Fred Bridgland

<title>
I was extremely happy with my stay with Sonia and her family. The room and other facilities were exactly what I expected. Despite a busy work and family life Sonia and Chris were able to make time for their guests. They were very helpful and provided useful and reliable information. Their recommendations for eating and drinking were first rate.The area is pleasant with plenty of local amenities. If you're reasonably fit it's a 20 minute walk into town or over to the downs. Buses into town are frequent.I would certainly stay there again.
</title>
</document>
<document id="531">
<title>
Everything with the room, house, and location were as promised. Very convenient to the County Cricket Ground and easy access to the center of Bristol by way of the buses along Gloucester Road. Sadly I didn't get to meet Sonia or the kids as they were away on holiday but her husband Chris was a wonderful host on his own. Breakfast here is taken seriously with a full spread each morning. Even though the kids weren't there when I was there, they probably will be just about any other time. I hope only respectful, positive people will choose to stay here, the rest of you I suggest please look elsewhere.
</title>
</document>
<document id="532">
<title>
I spent a week at Sonia's, and I really enjoyed the time. It was a nicely decorated room. The kids are adorable. Sonia n Chris are very respectful and friendly. Definitely will recommend to others!! :D  
</title>
</document>
<document id="533">
<title>
I had a lovely time staying with Sonia. The kids are well behaved and quiet and having breakfast with them was so much fun. My room was clean and tidy, it contained a kettle with tea & coffee. 
</title>
</document>
<document id="534">
<title>
Staying here was just lovely, really peaceful and comfortable. Sonia and Chris made me feel very welcome, and it's very easy to get along with them and the little ones. Fantastic breakfast included, WiFi allowed me to check my emails and do my research, and most appreciated free tea in the bedroom so I could feel even more refreshed in the morning.  It was also a blessing that I could use the shower when I got home-after long days of physical theatre and dance, that's just what I needed!The area is ideal if you're looking for a reasonably priced stay in a central location. It's a 20 minute stroll to Stokes Croft, plus there's a bus stop just over the road with buses heading to the centre, UWE, Cribbs Causeway and Temple Meads very frequently. You'll have no trouble finding places for food, as it's on the Gloucester Road, there are whole-food stores, foreign food shops and supermarkets galore. Morrisons is just down the road and Sainsburys is just up the road. What more could you ask for? All in all a perfect stay, so many thanks Chris & Sonia and much love x

Sonia was very welcoming from the start! The location was brilliant just off Gloucester Road and the room was excellent. It was comfortable and perfect to stay for a few days or even a whole week like I did. Sonia has a lovely family and very well behaved kids. Really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it!

<title>
Sonia, Chris and their children are a really lovely family, their house literally makes you feel at home!I had a wonderful stay at this place, enjoyed the fact that they were very welcoming and helpful to me if needed, I definitely recommend them!The everyday breakfast was just perfect, the place is close to the main road where you can catch the bus to go into town, and there were a lot of supermarkets and restaurants around.
</title>
</document>
<document id="537">
<title>
There are three lovely angels! I recommend everyone who like kids to stay this place. Chris and Sonia are kind and friendly. Even though they seemed to be busy to take care of their children, they tried to communicate with me. I enjoyed talking with them. The room and bathroom are cosy. They offered breakfast: cereals, toasts with a variety of jams, yogurt and juice tea. That was good, and it was such a nice breakfast with a performance by a lovely dancer! Children are nice, so I did not feel anything uncomfortable. The location is convenient. It is only 20 min by bus. I strongly recommend this place! Thank you so much!

Staying at Sonia's was amazing. Although she wasn't there during my stay and I stayed for a very short period, the house is really nice 2 min from Gloucester rd which seems a lot interesting. Sonia's husband was truly helpful and kind, and their children are amazing!I hope I will be able to come back for more time there.

This room is just perfect!! Is very spacious and also has a desk in case you need to work during your stay. A very beautiful house, lovely family, great host (who also cooks great pancakes)The house is 1min. walking distance from bus stop, a lot of restaurants, pubs and two supermarkets. It couldn't be better!

<title>
Sonia's house was perfectly located for my training at St Werburghs, the house was cosy, relaxing and in a peaceful area within easy reach of local shops and restaurants. Although I didn't meet Sonia in person as she was away on holiday she made all the necessary arrangements to make my check in easy and stay comfortable. Parking was a bit tricky but this could have been because I arrived later in the day, if you are not so confident at parallel parking I would advise arriving in good time when I presume there would be more space. Sonia kindly offered me use of her bike which if I had more time to spare I would have taken advantage of. Overall a wonderful stay greatly enhanced by her three friendly cats who were great company.

Sonia is a really lovely host, and was really clear and helpful when I arrived. Sadly I found the room a bit lacking as the bed is a really small slightly rickety fold out futon. I’m 5’7” and I struggled to get any sleep at all which was a real shame. I cancelled the rest of my stay.

It was an honour and a privilege to meet and stay with this well-organised family.  The house is  full of character, has been tastefully extended, is well maintained and is very clean.   The room has fast internet and a large desk for one's paperwork.   The house is in a a quiet residential street but close to a bus route offering a  good service to Temple Meads station.   Nearby Gloucester Road has a wide choice of shops.   My only niggle - I was  unsure what parts of the house and facilities the guests were able to use.

Fi's room was tastefully decorated and comfortable.  The house is charming with wooden floors and very clean.

<title>
Comfortable and quiet, convenient and good value, Fiona’s house was perfectly positioned for my visit, with a big Sainsbury’s next door, and the no. 1 bus to Temple Meads railway station and the University district at the other end if the road. I bought a three-day pass to the Barrow Road (Website hidden by Airbnb) a mile away, and went for a fantastic run along the Avon, half a mile away. A couple of times I walked back from the Uni: a good shlep, but not excessive. Lovely clean bathroom, nice hot shower on call - everything I needed, at a good price. Fiona was lovely: I arrived late on day one, and left early on day five, and came and went at all hours in between, and nothing was ever a problem. I’ll go back next time I’m in Bristol. Highly recommended.

I had a great time staying with Bea. This really is a 'home from home' as the advert states. I was greeted with a big hug on arrival, and Bea was warm welcoming and essentially a great host throughout my stay - doing everything she could to accommodate me and make sure I had everything I needed. Bea's place is cosy, relaxed and informal and is in a great location as it is only a short 15-20 minutes bus ride to the city centre - perfect for exploring Bristol. I definitely hope to return in the future.
</title>

Bristol was such a beautiful city and what made my six weeks stay more enjoyable was Bea's friendly, kind and welcoming personality, always ready to help. The house, garden and room are lovely.The location is good, quiet and peaceful area, close to wonderful parks, a nature reserve (great for outdoor exercise) and 20 minutes by bus (which run frequently) to the city centre.Would come back and would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Bea is such a nice person. She is kind and very welcoming. She is always asking about your needs and makes you feel comfortable. The house is very charming, there is a bus stop near to her place, so it's easy to go downtown by bus, and also there is a good supermarket next to the bus stop, so you will feel totally well served. Bea is a very attentive person and her accommodation is just like as it seems through this description, nice and comfortable for a fair price.

Bea is such a thoughtful and hospitable host that I felt truly at home and decided to stay longer.Bes's place is in a quiet residential area in East Bristol about 20 minutes bus ride to the city center when it is not rush hour.And the bus station is really (Website hidden by Airbnb) would be a perfect location if you want to visit Bristol and Bath and the same time because Bath is just a bus ride away.I highly recommend Bea's place.

Bea was very helpful and provided useful advice about the local area. She is an interesting women to have a conversation with and very friendly. Room is as described in the pictures and information.

Bea is a lovely and warm host and makes you feel very comfortable in her home. The room is simple and clean and is definitely big enough. Good value for money. I would definitely recommend friends and family to stay at Bea's.

My stay with Bea was really enjoyable, loved it! Great room, great house, awesome garden there really wasn’t much more I needed! I would recommend this stay to everyone. Was super easy to get around, There is a bus less that a minute walk that goes straight to the city centre and the house is close to a nice parkwoodlands.

Everything's really good, cleanliness, organisation and adequate spaces. The bedroom is exactly of the photos. The location is good, the bus stop is only 3 min from the house. If you like doing exercise you can visit a beautiful natural reserve by foot for only 7 min. Bea is a lovely, friendly and supportive person.

Bea is friendly and lovely. I feel comfortable staying with her because the house is clean. She has got a beautiful garden with many plants. There is a bus stop directly to town 4 mins away from the house by walking. Co-op is just nearby the bus stop, so don't worry if you need some food.

It was very nice to stay at Bea's house. Clean house, a warm welcome, open for conversation, but she also accepted my privacy, which was very nice for someone introverted like me. :) The area is also very beautiful and quiet but with an excellent bus connection to the inner city. Unfortunately, due to the coronavirus I had to leave early and could not spend the full 3 months in Bristol, but Bea was very caring for our safety and gave me a lot of advice and gloves and a facemask for puplic transport and the airport, which was very helpful and more than I expected from an Airbnb host. If I ever come back to Bristol, I would definitely try coming back to Bea. :)

I had a marvellous stay here.  This is not your usual B&B or room only.  It's an exquisite, affordable stay in a unique house that offers exclusive use of the top floor bedroom, private bathroom and readingrelaxation room and is located in a beautiful Bristol suburb.  Kevin and Lesley are great:  had I not been working, it's doubtful I'd have needed the bed at all as I could have happily stayed up all night chatting to them.  This is the perfect house in the perfect setting with the perfect hosts and  is well worth it.

There can not possibly be any better hosts than Kevin and Lesley - both such friendly and welcoming people!  Along with lots of great conversation, they helped us out in so many ways, such as providing us with tips on things to do and places to go.  We were entitled to the entire top floor (among many other amenities), which included a gorgeous bedroom with en suite bathroom, as well as an additional room.  The entire property is beautiful, well kept, and is located in a very nice area.  We had a lovely time and would definitely recommend it!

I would highly recommend staying here.  I had a wonderful stay and felt like part of the family.  Kevin and Lesley are wonderful hosts and so easy going.

What a truly wonderful place to stay.  Kevin and Lesley are perfect hosts and went out of their way to look after us.  They collected us from the airport, and made us feel very welcome in their beautiful home.  Kevin gave us a lift into town and recommend places to go and sights to see.On our last day, we sat in their glorious garden in the sun and Lesley made us homemade brownies.  I would truly recommend this as a wonderful place to stay with two lovely people who really understand how to make people welcome into their home.

We stayed at Kevin's and Lesly's house for 3 nights. It was the most pleasant stay of our 5 station trip through England. The house is very comfy, the garden is fantastic and the hosts are very helpful in every respect. The room and bathroom are very private as they are on the upmost floor. Our little son especially loved stirring up the pond with the fishing net ;-) We'll be happy to come back anytime.

Kevin and Lesley are wonderful host. We arrived as strangers but left as friends. My son loves the AGA in their house and misses Kevin who gave him very kind pastoral care during the 11 days we were there. We will certainly meet them again.I highly recommend their BnB.

We had a most delightful stay in this beautiful house and garden.  The central location in the desirable village of Westbury with its restaurants, cafes and small shops is very convenient. Being only 10 minutes by car from Clifton and Bristol allows one to combine the benefits of a quiet suburb with easy access to the city centre.Lesley and Kevin were the perfect hosts: always friendly, always ready to help or offer advice, always interesting to talk to. They soon made friends with our 5 year old grandson and were very patient with his questions. We were very comfortable and felt very much at home.We look forward with pleasure to staying here again on future trips to Bristol.

Lesley and Kevin are fantastic people. Their attention to detail is second to none and they really pride themselves in being lovely thoughtful hosts. I really enjoyed my stay and appreciated being accommodated at the last minute. I was even given a Banksy cup to drink my coffee :) and Lesley kindly found me books to help with my study!.. The house is beautiful you feel as if you are in Italy or France on a sunny day..I would recommend anyone coming to Bristol to stay here without a second thought. Thankyou Lesley and Kevin you really inspired me.

Lesley and Kevin are very warm and kind people, they are very open minded and whenever you enter their house using their kitchen they never give the feeling your an intruder. A B&B super exstra + I would say. The house is hidden in a court, surrounded with several gardens and green fields. Satnav has a lot of difficlties finding it. So before you find it an introduction to the neighbourhood is already made !thanks again !Joost, Asia and Samiwa

We had a terrific 4 night stay at Trym House - excellent friendly hosts made us feel immediately at home and what a beautiful home it is with a stunning secluded garden, a very comfy bed, lovely breakfasts and lots of help with maps and info on Bristol.  It is well positioned for exploring Bristol, Bath and the whole area around there and it is lovely and quiet too. We plan to become hosts ourselves and Kevin really showed us the way. Evelyn and Andy

We could not have asked for a more warm welcome to the Trym House. Our hosts were fantastically hospitable, kind and generous, and the house and its gardens were amazing. Had we had more time, I'm sure we would have loved to just take in the glorious surrounds of the accommodation — reading and relaxing in the many nooks and crannies. I'm so grateful that Kevin and Lesley have opened their place to share with travellers. Their own stories, as well as their willingness to help others find their way (we came with no plan for our weekend!) was overwhelming.

Our time spent at Trym house with Kevin and his wife Lesley has been an absolute pleasure. From day one we were made to feel welcomed and at home. Trym House and its occupants alike are full of character and charm.Our room was well equipped, cleaned regally and comfortable. The home itself is set in lovely gardens and a short walk from Blaise Castle estate.  I could not recommend a stay at Trym House with Kevin and Lesley enough for people coming to Bristol for a short break or for an extended stay.

This is a really lovely house and Kevin is an exemplary host. He couldn't have made us more welcome. He was very flexible, accommodating and helpful. He even drove us into town so we could take a particular walk without bothering with our car. The rooms are beautiful, the bed is very comfortable and there are lots of places to sit and relax. Breakfast was laid out for us, beautifully, and we had a very happy sense of being able to come and go as we pleased but also being well looked after. Communication was excellent. We will definitely go back.

What a wonderful stay! My two housemates and I stayed at Kevins tranquil house for a long weekend and all three of us couldn't have been happier or more relaxed during our stay. The house other than being gorgeous was very clean with comfortable beds. We shared an Ensuite between us and had the top floor all to ourselves. The house itself is a short bus ride into Bristol and Kevin was so helpful in letting us know the best ways round the town and into bath. A big thank you to Kevin and his wife for making us feel so much at home...oh and not forgetting the lovely breakfasts.

Our trip to Bristol was more memorable because of our stay at Trym House. Kevin and Leslie were wonderful hosts and made us feel at ease from our first contact. It was a lovely house in a wonderful village just outside Bristol, well connected by public transport and we had no problems getting around. Kevin had offered to pick us up from the airport as we weren't driving (he just charged for the petrol). We were carrying a large amount of luggage as we were going to drop our son for Uni. He helped us the next day to take the whole lot to the Halls.Trym house is a wonderful place, it is a listed property with a lot of character, comfortable and very calming. There are many shops nearby as well as a range of restaurants and some nice pubs so one doesn't have to have to Bristol to have a nice time either.We look forward to visiting Kevin and Lesley again.

My first Airbnb experience, and a very good introduction too! Couldn't fault the welcome, cleanliness, and the "open house, be my guest", here. A very fine house in beautiful gardens, all set in a perfect location.

Historic Trym is just a fabulous house. I had a very warm, relaxed and friendly welcome from Lesley who couldn't have been more helpful.  I had a very lovely ensuite bedroom which was immaculate, with the most comfortable bed. My stay was very short as I was in Bristol for a friends party, but I was made to feel very much at home and told to help myself to tea, coffee and breakfast food in the kitchen if I wanted a lie in. Lesley even offered to run me to my friends house (I arrived by traintaxi). I really think this is one of the nicest guests houses I have stayed in, with a genuinely very lovely host. I would highly recommend Historic Trym to anyone!

Kevin and Lesley are the consummate hosts!  Their house is absolutely beautiful and very homely. We were made to feel very welcome and comfortable.

I cannot thank Kevin and Lesley enough for their kind hospitality and warm welcome.  They provided a real 'home from home' for myself and my two young daughters.  My 9 year old was very grateful for her lesson in pancake making and my 5 year old giggled constantly! They adored the garden and were immediately at home.  The rooms were perfect for us and the whole experience made our short stay a real holiday.  A really lovely experience.

Trym House is a charning home in a peaceful and secluded location, just 2.8miles from central Bristol. We were able to park securely on the private drive, surrounded by a beautiful, traditional English garden.Kevin and Lesley are delightful hosts and we enjoyed sitting around the real fire in the lounge and cooking porridge on the Aga!  A peaceful night was spent in the attic room and we woke to see the camelia breaking into flower just outside the bedroom windows. I have stayed in many Airbnb's now and this must rank as one of my top five favourites.

Fabulous week - a taste of village tranquility & history in the midst of modern busy Bristol. Kevin & Lesley share their beautiful home and peaceful garden with attentive and unobtrusive presence and willing advice when sought. It is even more than the website suggests. Their restoration, eclectic library, manicured garden with varied themed sections, sun-drenched courtyards (yes, we were blessed with good weather!) & whimsical historical artefacts provides a refuge making you want to relax and enjoy where you are. So much to see around the south west from this base, yet so much to savour about the base. Daily breakfast was leisurely and healthy and dinner is easy with many choices literally around the corner in Westbury-On-Trym "village" if you do not venture further afield. Our only regret was we had to move on - thanks for a memorable stay and for being excellent hosts who have it just right. We hope we make it back sometime.

My husband and I stayed at the Trym House in early June, 2016.  Our hosts, Kevin and Leslie, were the epitome of warmth and helpfulness. The accommodations were quite comfortable, but it is the setting that sets Trym House apart. The house is surrounded by immaculate gardens overflowing with beautiful flowers that enclose intimate courtyards where one can enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. Trym House really deserves its rating as a five-star B and B.

I was in Bristol for work and had a great stay with Kevin and Lesley.The room and en-suite are really comfortable and clean, and I slept soundly both nights. The house and its location are perfectly described both in the listing and the reviews I read before choosing to book here.Kevin and Lesley were great at communicating before the trip and we had some interesting chats whilst I was there too - so much so that, on Day 2, I set myself an alarm for the point at which I needed to leave the conversation at the breakfast table to ensure I got to work on time!

Staying in the Trym House was a true delight. Kevin and Leslie are the consummate hosts - warm, inviting, lovely people, full of excellent information about the surrounding area. The house is wonderful with an abundance of character. The room is comfortable and well appointed, with a clean and functional bathroom. On the third floor, you will awaken to the sound of birdsong from the eye level treetops. Westbury on Trym is a fantastic neighborhood with a lovely village feel. There are several restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance, as well as a Tescos. Downtown Bristol is a short drive or a lovely walk. The house is well positioned for visitors to Southmead Hospital, Airbus and Rolls Royce.I cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough and would return in a heartbeat. Thank you Leslie and Kevin!

Such a lovely flat and a really accommodating host. Ingrid even left goodies for us in the fridge, and the flat far exceeded our expectations in that the photos make it look stunning, but it was cosy and fully equipped too! Lovely time there, and we will definitely use again if we come to Bristol.

Ingrid has achieved both!Great host, very helpful and friendly.Cannot reccomend highly enough. SO much better value than a hotel. I noticed you could stay in a bland box room at the Holiday Inn for the same price... Fabulous

Ingrid's flat was quite nice.   The area of Montpellier unfortunately was not.   Parking was a little difficult, very crowded and narrow.   We would probably have preferred to be given fresh butter and spreads than leftovers from someone else's stay.   For the money I wouldn't stay there.   We wouldn't call it luxury.

Simply Gorgeous. The flat is elegant, very clean (no shoes allowed inside so the floors are properly clean - I loved this), and has very high ceilings and large french doors resulting in a lot of natural light.  The flat itself is large, very well appointed, and no detail is left unaddressed.  Simply the best airbnb I've stayed in (though I am rather new at this).  You can tell that Ingrid (the lovely host) has put a lot of thought and time into designing and decorating the space, and continues to care tremendously about its upkeep.  She even provided some basic food items (milk, bread, butter) to get us going.  The location is about a 10 minute cab ride from the Bristol Temple Meads Station and the area (Montpelier) is a bit bohemian (both in the gritty and the refreshingly uncommercial sense).  I wish we had stayed here for longer. Highly recommended.

Ingrid's apartment is really great and you can instantly see that careful attention has been spent on the little details that make it feel both stylish and very comfortable. The apartment is really spacious, very clean and came equiped with all of the helpful basics that you'd need for a short stay. There's also a great garden which is almost as big as the flat! Ingrid was also the perfect host - quick communications, very welcoming and even provided us with milk, bread and orange juice which was much appreciated after spending a long evening out in Bristol! Highly recommended, I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time I visit Bristol.

We stayed three weeks at Ingrid's place, we liked it so much we are coming back in two months for  a one week stay. The place is in a very nice setting , extremely quiet,  it is listed as an apartment but you have full use and view of the garden which makes it more like a house. It's complete and furniches and decorated as if you would be living permanently in the place which makes you feel at home. Ingrid is very helpful and if there is anything you need she will provide it. We were extremely pleased and are happy to go back and spend some more days at the place.

This abode was relaxing, bright and convenient. The host is lovely and also so generous - having left us some nice basics for breakfast and being very accommodating and chilled. We enjoyed everything from the easy check-in to signing the wonderful guest book when leaving. I hope to stay again!

The apartment is great! Spacious, quiet, clean and homely. Perfect base for a weekend in Bristol. We only met Ingrid briefly but she was very welcoming and had left some supplies (orange juice, bread, etc) in the fridge for us which was appreciated. Having discovered what a great city Bristol is, I hope to return and stay in the apartment again.

Fantastic light garden flat, within easy walking distance of the city centre, yet good access from the motorway too. Ingrid made me feel very welcome and checked to make sure I had everything I needed.  Would highly recommend this flat and look forward to staying again.

Wow. This apartment is lovely. Very stylish modern decoration, very clean,  spacious & light, cool furniture, nice view - its a fantastic place. Its only a 5 min walk from a really nice neighbourhood of Bristol (Montpelier), we enjoyed a really superb meal in a French restaurant round the corner called Bell's Diner. One of the best apartments i've had the fortune to discover so far on airbnb. Thanks Ingrid !

Ingrid's place is amazing, a real getaway from the ordinary. She has put a lot of effort into the small details and created a really warm space that is perfect for a week or a weekend, whatever amount of time you need it. Highly recommended spot!

We only stayed for one night, as a base while visiting friends in Bristol, but we wish we could have stayed longer and will definitely stay again. Montpelier is a lovely, diverse area and the apartment is just beautiful. It is clean, safe, and Ingrid is a friendly and unintrusive host. Providing OJ, bread, milk, tea and coffee is a lovely touch and was much appreciated. Strongly recommended for a real taste of Bristol!

We fell in love with this apartment! It's full of character and has been decorated beautifully. Ingrid was very accommodating, and the apartment was kitted out with everything we needed - including bread, milk etc which was hugely appreciated. The apartment was a great base from which to explore Bristol - it's a short walk from the independent shops and cafes on  Gloucester Rd. It's very quick and easy to get into the centre town from Montpelier train station which is just around the corner from the flat. We'd love to come back in the summer to make use of the terrace which the bedroom opens on to.

We absolutely loved our stay at Ingrid’s stunning flat.  Incredibly relaxing and quiet – beautifully designed, lit and furnished, fully-equipped kitchen with everything you might need to cook meals and a lovely garden area that we certainly would have used were it not such a cold weekend!Ingrid was helpful and friendly and has included thoughtful details in the flat such as board games and a sewing kit.The apartment is also near the buzzing Stokes Croft area, with lovely cafes and bars.We will definitely stay again if we come back to Bristol.

Lovely basement flat below (and separate from) the owners property - set on a hillside with views over Bristol.  The flat is beautifully decorated and would be perfect for a couple or a single person who wanted a full apartment.  We had two small children with us, and we managed to fit them in quite comfortably in the bedroom - with a travel cot for the baby and a mattress for the toddler.   There's a lovely garden with patio area, and all the amenities you would want - simple and helpful things like fruit juice, milk and bread.  Ingrid was very helpful, greeted us warmly, found a microwave for us and then left us to it.  Overall a lovely place to stay - highly recommended.  Thank you.

Ingrid is a very nice landlord.  The apartment is exceptionally great, very furnish with good taste.

We had such a good time in Ingrids appartment! It was very clean, welcoming and a beautiful Place to stay. It had everything we needed for the nights we stayed there and we just adored the garden and the patio with all the nice flowers. Ingrid was a very good host and I will recommend the Place to others. Thank you, Ingrid and have a Nice summer! :)

A really fantastic place to be!  Unsurpassed details and care to the property.  We felt at home in every ways and were thankful to Ingrid's effort and hospitality.  We were also very lucky to get parking space very close to the house.  We drove a mid-size car and were able to stay close to the wall without obstructing traffic.

This little apartment is just fantastic. Very well maintained, very stylish, and in a great, quirky area, not far from central Bristol at all. If you want something way more stylish than a hotel, and a more real feel of Bristol, then this is the place!  Will certainly return!

We spent a very pleasant four nights in Ingrid's beautiful apartment.  The decor and quality of furnishings and artwork was first class and Ingrid's hospitality and care to detail meant that we did not have to go shopping when we arrived because she had left supplies of bread, butter, milk, coffee, tea etc for us.  Both the living area and the bedroom have french doors leading out into the very pretty garden which has sweeping views down across the city.  The apartment is within walking distance of the city centre and there are some very nice restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.  We would definitely recommend the apartment to our friends next time they are planning a visit to Bristol.  Thanks!
</title>

<title>
We spent three nights chez Ingrid, and were delighted with the place.  A beautifully furnished flat, some key essentials and a cot and toddler bed greeted us when we walked in the door. I stayed alone with our two small children as we are relocating to Bristol and  were looking for a place to live around the Montpelier area. Ingrid shared her knowledge of the area and helped wrangling the kids and bags down the stairs. The sun came out the last day and we let the beauty of the garden in by opening the french doors. My eldest enjoyed exploring the various delights of the garden, and we even got to see a Montpelier fox.Thank you Ingrid for the wonderful stay in your garden flat. (If only we could find a place to live so nice!)

Ingrid's garden apartment is a true home from home. We stayed for a couple of nights visiting our son at UWE. It was a great base, very well equipped and suitable for our 19 month old.  It was lovely for our son to come and have an evening meal with us and stay over. Ingrid is a very thorough host even putting a sheet on the sofa bed in preparation! The tea coffee etc on arrival is very welcome and having access to the garden is a bonus.  We are already looking forward to returning... for longer next time!

Great flat. Comfortable, spacious & decorated tastefully. Great garden & views. It's in a good location not only handy for the centre but with lots of interesting shops & restaurants close by.

My family visited me in Bristol and we all stayed in Ingrid's flat. The place was beautifully clean and tidy, light, very stylish, well equipped, child friendly, and had a sense of home (we all referred to it as home even though we were there for only 4 days). The lovely garden is a bonus! Ingrid provided us with basic food upon arrival, was very friendly and very helpful. Montpellier is a lovely area and was very convenient for us. I have already recommended Ingrid and her flat to friends and it will be our first choice if accommodation is required again.

A beautiful flat and a lovely host. Perfect for get away, whether you want some privacy in a contained peaceful flat with an excellent view, or want to be close to the city (only 15 mins walk away). Located in one of my favourite parts of Bristol (Montpellier) the artistic alternative delights of Picton St, Cheltenham and Gloucester Road aren't far away. Flat is set up as the entire basement floor of Ingrid's home (the above few floors) with a separate entrance and opens up onto the garden. Well equipped, secure, and private, with a really lovely host who helped us with any queries and even a last minute lift to the bus station! I wholeheartedly recommend, and cannot wait to visit again.

My partner and I had a great stay in Ingrid's apartment. While the weather was a bit wild and wooly when we arrived in Bristol, Ingrid's placed offered a warm and inviting place to stay. We loved the area, the cafe's & restaurants and being in such a great location to explore nearby Bath and other scenic locations. I would highly recommend a visit to Casamia restaurant which offers a once in a life-time food experience (although on the pricey side). Ingrid's place was clean and lovely, roomy and very comfortable.

My friend and I went to Bristol for a weekend conference and chose to stay at Ingrid's apartment simply because it looked so beautiful on this website. Needless to say we weren't disappointed: it is absolutely gorgeous (and we were the very first visitors to try out her new brand kitchen)! There's nothing better than coming back to somewhere so stunning after a long day: to the extent that we cut short our evenings out to come back and chill out in comfortable luxury. In fact, I felt quite jealous of Ingrid's previous tenants who stayed there for a couple of months for work reasons. It really was a home from home (only without kids - joy!). Loved the apartment and that it had its own entrance, loved the bed, the building and the decor, loved the area, loved Ingrid's warm welcome. Will be sure to return with my husband for a kiddie-free weekend in future.Many thanks tack! ;-)

I stayed in Ingrid's beautiful apartment for 8 nights with my husband and our two year old son Lukas.We wanted to stay somewhere central and with a garden, this apartment ticked all the boxes. As one can see from the photo's, it is very tastefully furnished and it has a wonderful tranquil and cozy feel to it, with great city views.Furthermore, it was nice and warm, very clean and also very quiet.Ingrid is a lovely and very friendly host and it was a great pleasure meeting her.We will definitely be staying here again!

We only wished we could spend more time there and make use of the kitchen and garden!

Ingrid has created a lovely place to have as a base for exploring Bristol. There's quite a bit of graffiti around Montpellier, which can make it feel a little edgy, but it felt safe. There are some lovely places to eat in the area, and it's an easy walk into the city. The parking on her street is very narrow and you have to park the car as close to the wall as possible and the driver may have to climb out the passenger door if you've parked that way round.The kitchen is well-equipped, although we didn't need to prepare too much.

Entry to the apartment was simple with keys provided by the simple to operate key safe.  The apartment was very clean, bright and warm. The garden, which is accessed from french windows from the living room was beautiful with delicious apple and pear trees etc.This is a nice quirky  and cosmopolitan area of Bristol with some quaint coffee shops etc. It is an easy walk in to the city centre . Indeed my wife and I even strolled over to the yuppy Clifton town centre in about 30 minutes. Clifton is worth seeing and having lunch at.Have no hesitation in recommending Ingrid's apartment to anyone. We would very definately return

Ingrid's flat is really beautiful - smartly decorated, warm, comfortable, light and airy with a panoramic view of the city from the garden. One of the nicest Airbnb's I've stayed in! Very well equipped with everything you could possibly need and in a great, very bohemian part of the city with lots of independent cafes and bars within walking distance. Ingrid very thoughtfully stocked the kitchen with tea, ground coffee, orange, bread and butter so we didn't have to shop for essentials the first day we arrived.I'd definitely book again if I come back to Bristol. Many thanks!

We loved the apartment and the location, just a short walk to the bustling suburbs of Montpellier and Stokes Croft which, ticked all the right boxes for us. The area caters for all tastes and is very diverse compared to a city center location. Foodies and drinkers will not be disappointed. The city centre is approx. 1520 mins walk with easy access to Cabot Circus.  Ingrid made us feel very welcome and all of the little touches make this apartment stand out, we would love to return when the weather improves and make full use of the garden. Hope to see you again soon.

Ingrid was the perfect host and very welcoming.  The apartment was exceptional with all the necessary amenities and was presented in immaculate condition. The location is absolutely perfect for families visiting Bristol, very close to the city centre (10-15 mins walk) but not slap bang in the centre of all the hustle and bustle. Overall very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend and will certainly be staying there again on our next visit to Bristol.

Ingrid was so lovely and really welcoming even letting us arrive super early although the official check in was 12. She also let us stay as long as we wanted on the day we were leaving.Flat is every inch as lovely at the pictures. Really close to all the cool arty places and a million restaurants of Montpelier. It was freezing cold in Brisol the weekend we visited and it's the perfect snuggled up bolt hole too if you just don't feel like leaving.

A great base for a four night stay in Bristol.  Loved the area.  Great recommendation for restaurant from Ingrid.  Felt very much like home.  Shame there wasn't a bath but apart from that it was a very well equipped cosy apartment.  Bring a small car as parking tight!

Had a really great time at Ingrid's. The place is light and airy and very clean. Ingrid left some essentials in the fridge and provided ample kitchenware as well. A nice pot of coffee, towels, soap and shampoo... all in all the apartment was well equiped (with good quality stuff too)! The apartment itself is beautiful and close to all the best spots in Bristol. We also found a parking space on her road without any problems. I can't fault it. Thank you very much Ingrid. xx

We loved Ingrid's flat. It was even better in the flesh and the garden was a real bonus. Beautifully decorated with everything you could need and a shortish walk into the city center made it a great location. Also, lots of lovely quirky cafes and shops in the very close vicinity. We liked the Bristolian on Picton Road for coffee and the little Italian supermarket also on Picton Road which was great for supplies.Ingrid was charming and helpful and made the whole process very easy. We'd go again and happily recommend to others.

We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Ingrid's flat.  She gave us a warm welcome making us feel welcome and 'at home' straight away.  We loved the flat for not only did it have a calm yet quirky feel it was also the lightness of it's high ceilings and the space. The garden was an absolute delight giving private yet unexpected views over the  rooftops in the distance. Montpelier was surprisingly hilly and a great area to explore especially with Ingrid's local knowledge of quirky pubs and eating places.  
</title>

<document id="798">
<title>
Ingrid was unavailable during our stay but she made great efforts to communicate by text and email, setting out all necessary, useful and interesting information. The flat is lovely; bright, well equipped and spacious with a beautiful garden and it is in a great neighbourhood, Montpelier. We would like to stay here again on our next visit to Bristol.

We'd like to thank ingrid for having us stay in her beautiful apartment, couldn't have asked for a better weekend. Really appreciated the attention to detail and effort that has been put in to finishing this gorgeous place. The garden was perfect to enjoy the sun and watch the fantastic Bristol balloon fiesta from, brilliant location close enough to all the amazing bars and restaurants without being totally in the thick of it. Thanks again for everything Ingrid.

Ingrid was very organized from the moment we booked her apartment. She was kind, very open and helpful. It was a pleasure to meet her after we arrived.  We really like the Montpelier neighborhood. The house is beautifully cared for and was easy to find. Her directions and instructions were clear. It is a very comfortable place, clean and well furnished. We felt instantly at home. The garden was a huge bonus on beautiful days. The space was well arranged for our family of 4. Our kids were happy together on the pull out sofa. It is an easy walk to the local bakery in the morning and to restaurants at night. We had access to all of the city from her place and explored Bristol on foot. We are considering a move to Bristol and hope to find something near by. We recommend Ingrid's place wholeheartedly. And, hope to meet her again one day soon! Thanks, Ingrid!

Ingrid's apartment is lovely and light and really well equipped.  She left some milk and bread in the fridge which was kind of her.

A lovely clean apartment in a good location . Great communication from Ingrid with booking and checking in. Interesting area and great advice from Ingrid where to eat and have a drink out.

I travelled to Bristol with my partner and our 8 month old twins and Ingrid was the most perfect host! She lent us a large baby cot to make sure our little ones slept comfortably and made everything ready for us. The flat is decorated with taste and is located close to public transport (bus #5 to go to the city centre), restaurants and cafes. The garden overlooks the city and is really beautiful. This area of Bristol has very steep streets so it might not be the best choice for someone with reduced mobility. Thank you Ingrid for your kindness and flexibility :)

A beautiful property, clean, bright and spacious with everything that you could possibly need. The garden is also an absolute delight. Location is easy for everything - you arrive off the motorway and are at the property within minutes, but you are also 10 min walk from the heart of Bristol. I really really enjoyed the space, Ingrid obviously has lovely taste and is very thoughtful and considerate of her guests needs.

Great apartment with everything you need. It was lovely to arrive and find essentials in the fridge for a much needed cup of tea after a long journey. The area is fab with great restaurants and night life near by. There is a local train station about a 10 minute walk away or you can walk into the centre and take in the sights (graffiti!) along the way. The apartment is very tastefully decorated with a stunning garden to the rear. Ingrid was very helpful when we needed her, a nice balance of being there when needed but not omnipresent.

Ingrid's flat was lovely. Spacious, bright, with a magical sunny garden for reading and hanging out. The area is perfect for music, food, and exploring Bristol... everything Montpelier and Stokes Crodt have to offer are a short walk, and yet the place is very quiet. Ingrid herself is thoughtful and kind, and provides all you need for a great escape.

My wife, son, and I enjoyed a very comfortable week in Ingrid's flat. He slept on the pull-out sofa bed and we slept in the bedroom. Checking in and exploring the neighborhood were easy thanks to Ingrid's helpful instructions. The Montpelier area has some lovely little restaurants, coffee shops, and bars, and a lot of character. We found it easy to get most places on foot. The flat itself was spacious, airy, light, and extremely clean, with large windows, pleasant modern furnishings, and lots of conveniences. The kitchen had everything we needed to make light meals (and was well equipped enough that we could have cooked even more extensively if we'd wanted to). We were only sorry that the time of year precluded our sitting in the cozy private garden, which offers a nice view of the city. We would definitely stay here again.

Stayed at Ingrid's over the weekend for a little break for a birthday with a few friends, some of which it was their first time visiting the city. The apartment is absolutely gorgeous not to mention a lovely garden with view that looks over  the city skyline. Ingrid was quick to respond to any questions and left lots of helpful suggestions of places to see and eat at. Just a short walk from stokes croft and Gloucester rd it was very easy to get around and the perfect place to stay for a city break in bristol. Thanks Ingrid for having us!

Ingrid's flat is spotlessly clean, wonderfully light and airy and has everything you need for a very enjoyable visit to Bristol.Comfy bed, which is a priority for me, great view over Bristol and if the weather had been warmer and drier would have enjoyed sitting outside in the pretty garden for breakfast.We didn't meet Ingrid but check in and out was very easy using a key safe. Lots of instructions left on places to go etc. Thoroughly enjoyed the Thali restaurant down the road and would love to visit the flat again.

The flat was in a great location with plenty of nearby amenities. It was cozy and very stylish with thoughtful items left for our use. The garden was beautiful and we sat in it often with morning coffee and afternoon tea and cake. We will be recommending this flat for any of our Canadian friends travelling as well as our UK friends and family.

Perfect house with amazing style and very clean. Garden is a true gem unfortunately we cannont use it much becouse of the terrible weather! Ingrid is very helpfull ( once we got to the apartment  we asked Her the possibility to are a bene and she immediately did it) and friendly !only suggestion not to rent a very big car ( we rented a 7 seats car) because the street is very very narrow! We will return!

Lovely, clean stylish space. All possible amenities and many details above and beyond our expectations - great kitchen, large bathroom with toiletries, basic breakfast  requirements in the fridge, lovely garden outside. Compared with other experiences of staying in Bristol it was above all so quiet. All communication with our host was prompt and clear. Definitely will return.

It makes such a difference to stay in a place that has all the lovely little touches that you would want as well as the big important things like a great location and helpful host. The apartment was spotless on arrival and we could not have been better placed in the city. We were staying with a small baby and the setting allowed us to pop her to bed in the bedroom and have a few old friends around for dinner. It was a very special weekend we hope to stay again. We would highly recommend to other interested guests

A lovely Airbnb  overall. The host’s communication was superb, the location was ideal and the apartment was extremely clean, tidy and stylish.There was unfortunately one thing that was quite disappointing. When we were researching Airbnbs in Bristol we specifically wanted a fireplace to light in the evenings. We live in a city apartment and don’t have a fireplace, so the fact this place had one in the lounge was ideal and we were really looking forward to cosy winter nights in with the fireplace lit. Unfortunately, upon arrival we learned that lighting the fireplace is not allowed and we felt this should have been clear in the description.

Ingrid’s place is perfect! It is beautifully decorated inside and out. Our favorite area was her garden patio complete with an outstanding view of the city. It is walking distance to many great cafes, bars, restaurants and independent stores. I stayed here with a group of 3 and we were all comfortable.  I definitely plan on returning! It has been my favorite place to stay on our England travels.

Ingrid's place is beautiful! Stylishly decorated in a very quiet street, near enough to the fun of Stokes Croft without being too near. The apartment is large for 2 people and the garden space is a great bonus. The flat was spotless on arrival and Ingrid was easy to contact and communicative thorughout. Would definitely stay again!

The flat is in an unsavoury neighbourhood with homeless people and strange possible drug dealers at the end of the street very nearby. However the flat itself is very secure and has bars on the windows and a front lockable gate so we felt quite safe inside. Flat itself is nicely decorated and furnished and the garden is lovely. However there seems to be a damp problem unfortunately and it smelt mildewy on arrival particularly in the kitchen area.

Ingrid’s apartment was in a great location - within walking distance to Gloucester Road and Stokes Croft, and there’s a train station nearby (around a 10 minute walk). It was stylish and clean, and we would stay here again should we visit Bristol in the future.

Awesome apartment. I didn't want to leave. The street is quiet without being boring and convenient for Stokes Croft, Gloucester Road, etc. It's the best neighbourhood in Bristol. Ingrid is great. She lives upstairs but gives you plenty of space and is really communicative and helpful when you need her.  The apartment is very nicely decorated. Bed was comfortable. It was raining while I was there, but there is a lovely garden popular with the local fox and squirrels. I would definitely stay again.

A big thank you to Ingrid for our stay in Bristol. Her house is lovely and tidy, and we appreciated so much the little things, like there being milk and juice in the fridge for us when Ingrid did not need to do this for us. I highly recommend staying here!

Ingrid's place is lovely. Super clean and a really cool space. We stayed with our baby daughter for 2 nights and it was perfect. We arrived late on Friday night and the check in process was super easy as Ingrid had sent us really clear instructions beforehand. She'd also left lots of suggestions of places to eatdrinkget takeaway which was really helpful, along with some essentials in the fridge which was ideal. The only potential tricky thing about the place is the parking, although we were lucky enough to find a spot right outside! Would definitely recommend.

This flat is absolutely gorgeous. Despite the central location, it is very peaceful with a beautiful garden outside the french windows and the Bristol cityscape beyond.Ingrid has thought of everything you've forgotten to bring, including butter in the fridge and umbrellas in the cupboard.I was surprised at how child-friendly the place is, with a travel cot, highchair and folding buggy at our disposal.Thanks for a lovely weekend.

This was a lovely place to stay. It was very comfortable and had brilliant amenities. The location was fantastic (not far from a local high street or Cabot circus), so it is a great place to stay if you will be heading into the city centre often. The space was decorated in a very stylish way (which we all appreciated) and there was a great amount of help regarding the kitchen, bathroom etc waiting for us when we arrived! Highly recommend!

We left Spain in a hurry just before the lockdown and she was so accommodating of our situation. We literally booked on a Wednesday and moved in on Saturday to a wonderfully stylish, clean apartment with all of the comforts of home - including a separate side entrance (only a few steps down), fully equipped kitchen complete with dishwasher and induction stove and double oven, aa well as a washerdryer combo unit in the spacious bathroom. All that we would need to hunker down and make this home for the next month. Very comfortable furnishings incl wood floors, 2 fireplaces (both are non-usable but lovely to have!), french doors in the livng room and bedroom with direct access to our own patiogarden area that has views of the city. Great showers in the morning and a comfy queen bed make this a lovely and peaceful place to de-stress and self-isolate in. Ingrid is a friendly, energetic person who has been most helpful during this unusual time, with many recommendations on grocers, delivery services, etc. as there is not much else that we can do right now. She has been the perfect host and very quick to respond to our messages. We would definitely recommend her apartment to others and would stay again!

My friend and I had a great time visiting Bristol, due in part to the wonderful experience we had with Lis. She was excellent host, providing us with über comfortable beds, connecting us with an awesome bike tour, and giving great advice on where to eat and what to see, and accommodating our odd dietary requirements. Most importantly, we definitely felt more like friends, than BnB guests, at Lis's home. BONUS: In addition to being a great host, Lis also lives in a super interesting area. I don't think I would have enjoyed Bristol as much if I hadn't had the opportunity to explore her neighbourhood, and the interesting cafes and shops that you find there.
</title>

Warm and welcoming indeed! Lis' lovely central home was that and more- beautiful, clean and spacious apartment in Montpelier, near stokes croft, the liveliest most interesting bit of Bristol, close to everything yet an oasis of calm. And Lis herself is the consummate host: attentive, friendly, always ready to help with whatever. I was very fortunate to have found Lis and her lovely place!

We couldn’t have wished for a better place to stay in Bristol! Lis’ flat has been such a warm and comfortable home to us and we enjoyed staying in this relaxing place very much. It is ideally located in a very interesting area of Bristol and within walking distance to the centre and many other places. The room as well as the rest of the flat is very comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. Lis is an excellent host and we have to say it felt like staying with a friend, rather than just being guests. She is very friendly, helpful and went out of her way to make us feel comfortable yet respected our privacy. Lis gave us great recommendations on where to eat, what to see and answered any questions we had. Overall we couldn’t have asked for more and would certainly HIGHLY recommend her place to everyone coming to Bristol!

We had a wonderful visit. Lis had everything ready and was happy to give us some info on the surrounding area and recommendations. The room was as described. The double bed is two smaller ones pushed together but not at all uncomfortable. Breakfast was excellent as Lis had asked us ahead of time what we would like. A great place to base yourself for trips I to bristol downtown or drives to Bath!

If you would like to stay in Bristol stay here! I definitely can recommend this room! Lis is a perfect host with a very warm heart. She is flexible and a really good cook. It is so easy to walk into the city centre and shops are also very close by. I will miss her laugh and her cheerfulness. From the first day on I felt at home and not like a stranger.

This was a wonderful place to spend a month! The apartment is very nicely arranged and we were extremely comfortable. The kitchen was fully-equipped and always available to us. The private bathroom was very clean,and spacious. Location was convenient and very quiet, with excellent small grocery and convenience stores less than a minutes' walk away.Lis was the perfect hostess and always did all she could to make us feel welcome and comfortable.

I really enjoy chatting with her. Lis is a dog lover, and I am very appreciate her kindness! And there are private bathroom with everything needed. The room was extremely comfortable and cozy. Liz also offer me breakfast, and the lemon cake was very good! Highly recommend stay there, and I would stay at her place if I coming back!

Lis' cosy home was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn’t be happier about it. Lis was very welcoming, made us feel at home right away, and gave us recommendations and places to see in Bristol. We followed one of her recommendations to Thali (a restaurant 5 mins away from the house) and didn't regret it - so tasty!If you are a dog personlover you’ll be happy to stay at Lis'. We had the pleasure to meet 3 different dogs, all very lovely. If we’re ever back in Bristol, Lis will be our first choice. Totally recommended to stay with her. Thanks again!

First time airbnb stay - it was only brief, but Lis has set a high bar! She is a warm, welcoming host with a lovely home. The apartment is in a great location, close to the Stokes Croft area and an easy walk or bus ride into the centre. We had everything we needed, and Lis made sure that we were comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here!
</title>

<document id="943">
<title>
I have been staying with Lis for two months due to work commitments. It was my first experience of staying in an airb&b accommodation for such a prolonged period of time. I really enjoyed staying with Lis and her basset dog Mia and would recommend her accommodation to anybody without hesitation. Lis is a wonderful and very friendly person who made feel like at home all the time. Her flat is located very centrally within walking distance to the Cabot shopping centre and well connected to the rest of the city by buses. The St. Paul's neighbourhood has a very bohemian feel with a lot of independent shops, cafes and restaurants close by. I would definitely stay with Lis again the next time I visit Bristol.
</title>
</document>
<document id="944">
<title>
Lis was a very welcoming host. It was my first time in the city and she offered to meet me at the station and bring me to her home. She was always helpful with suggesting local areas and helping me find my way around. This was my first experience with a bnb and Lis was absolutely lovely.
</title>
</document>
<document id="945">
<title>
Lis was a generous and accommodating host during my 3 day stay at her apartment. The location was perfect for me - close to public transport and restaurants but on a quiet street in a lively part of Bristol. Having my own bathroom was great and everything was clean and tidy.
</title>
</document>
<document id="946">
<title>
Lis was a lovely host, she even came out and found us in the street when we got a bit lost finding her place! Her flat is very nice and clean and the room is comfortable and welcoming. Lis's flat is really convenient for the city centre, we walked there in less than 10 minutes, passing lots of cool looking shops, cafes and bars on the way. My husband and I only stayed one night as we were in Bristol for a wedding and Lis's place was just what we needed.

My first airbnb experience is highly possible to be the best one.The house was not hard to find and the house and room was exactly as described.You can have your own bathroom. You can find everything you need, especially the well-equipped kitchen. I love it.As for the host, Lis and Mia, they were warm-hearted. If you have any problem, just tell Lis and she would help you out. And you can  also walk the dog with Lis then you will find some beautiful parks in Bristol. Lis will also send you the photo of you and the dogs. If you are lucky enough, some other dogs, like Oscar and Sky may stay with you. Trust me. They are the most lovely and friendly things. I love them.All in all, I really suggest you stay here, especially for someone who loves dogs and cooking!!!I will miss here. 
</title>

<document id="948">
<title>
If you're looking for a friendly and warmly hearted host in a central and interesting part of Bristol than you have to stay with Lis and Mia in St.Pauls. The apartment and the room is just as described. Actually you will stay  in "doggy-land" with all this lovely dogs (like Oscar, Sky, Indie, Mad-Maddie, Diesel etc). I can really recommend  to stay with her. And from the first day on (for the whole month) is was more to stay with a friend - and at the end this was my first AirBnB experience and I am so glad to stayed with her.
</title>
</document>
<document id="949">
<title>
I had a nice couple of days with Lis.  She was a really welcoming host, and it was lovely having her basset, Mia, jump up to greet me on arrival!  The room was cosy, there were lots of nice cafes around the corner in Stokes Croft, and although I was out during the day, we made up for it by having long chats in the evenings!
</title>
</document>
<document id="950">
<title>
She was very supportive and cheerful, and I liked that she is understanding and thoughtful of making her client's feel comfortable with her dogs. 
</title>

Lis is such a sweet and warm hostess.  She was understanding when our flight got delayed and stayed up late to greet and welcome us.  She even went out of her way to drop us off at the train station the next day!  Lis' flat is very clean (even with all the dogs) and she kindly offered us breakfast in her well stocked kitchen.  Lis was never intrusive and she gave us some great restaurant recommendations and sightseeing ideas in Bristol.  Overall, Lis made our first Airbnb experience very memorable and enjoyable--we felt right at home.  We love all the dogs that stayed and played with us!  Thanks for taking care of us, Lis!

Lis was very welcoming and her dog is adorable. Bed was comfortable and the flat was nice and quiet, perfect for a few nights in Bristol.
</title>
</document>
<document id="953">
<title>
Lis's flat is pefectly located in the most vibrant part of Bristol - St Pauls and Stokes Croft -  with lots of good eateries close by and all barely a ten minute walk from the city centre shops and the main bus station. Her apartment is on the ground floor of a handsome Georgian terrace recently converted, and absolutely modern - and very warm and cosy. The single room (and it only a single bed for individual travellers!) is at the back of the building and is utterly quiet - which was a big plus for a light sleeper like me.Lis is a kind and warm host, and I was treated like a friend who had come to stay - no fuss, just easy. Great on communications before the visit so I always knew what was what, and a friendly and interesting person who I feel privileged to get to know a little. Its a doggie house, with main resident Mia and sometimes other critters, but tidy and spotlessly clean. Lis was able to be flexible around my needs and I hope I was the same for her - and this is what seems to make for the best of Air BnB experiences.I would definitely stay with Lis again - and almost certainly will! Negatives - really can't think of any. 
</title>

<title>
The words "warm and welcoming" are not merely written in the description, the moment you enter Lis' home that's the atmosphere you'll experience until you leave. In addition the accomodation is clean and tidy as well as located close to the city centre of Bristol. Lis is a very friendly host and she really does not only offer you an accommodation, but also helps you getting around the city. It's was lovely staying at Lis' and I can only recommend you to stay with Lis when visiting Bristol!

It was my second stay over with Lis within the same year. I was inBristol for two months on work placement in Southmead hospital. The flat is very conveniently located in St. Pauls, a very popular andtrendy part of Bristol with many cafes and local shops. It is locatedwithin a 10 min walk of the bus station and a 20 min bus trip to theTemple Meads Train station. The room is equipped with a single bed and a camp bed for short term visitors and there is a private bathroom for guests.Lis is a lovely, warm hearted person with whom you can share a glassof wine and have a chat in the evening but at the same time never intrusive. I loved to stay with her as her flat felt like home. If you like dogs there is a lot of possibilities to get a cuddle or a playwith Mia, the lovely basset who is the main resident or othercreatures big and small cared for by Lis.I strongly recommend to stay with Lis and I will definitely come back there one day.

Lis's place is really cool and lovely - feels like a piece of very arty Mediterranean in a district of Bristol. Lis could not have been more welcoming and friendly. Will head straight here if I need to stay in the area again.

We had a lovely stay with Lis. She was very chatty and super friendly. Lis was able to suggest lots of nice things to do in the local area as well as the city centre.Definitely make sure you like dogs because that is a big part of Lis' life (especially with Mia) as Lis boards dogs. We personally loved the cuddles. Nevertheless Lis keeps her home very clean and admitted to hoovering daily! Thanks Lis!

I stayed at Lis's place for 2 weeks. It was really the best Airbnb experience I've had! Lis is a very kind, fun and thoughtful host. Lis goes beyond a regular Airbnb service, shared some of her amazing Spanish dishes, had great conversations and really is a wonderful host. It felt like I was staying with an old friend.The flat is very tidy, very cosy and really well looked after. The room overlooks the garden and is quiet. The flat is just off Stokes Croft so getting to coffee shops, restaurants and shops is really easy. Lis is a wonderful host and I really recommend staying at Lis's!

Dogs are lovely.  I enjoyed having them around.Own bathroom a real bonus and my room was light and quiet, backing onto the garden.  No steps too!

Lis is a great host, she is very welcoming and chatty, she makes you feel at home and is available for anything you may need. The flat is great! First of all, you get to use your own bathroom, which is an incredible plus when you rent in a shared apartment. The house is beautifully way furnished and, if you like dogs, you'll find your paradise there!

Lis is an excellent host, her dogs Mia and Benji are so lovely! I have nice time here with Lis for two weeks, I can not forget the delicious Spain omelet and Indian takeaway! I will miss Lis and Mia and Benji

Lis' home is a great place to stay, be it for short or long term. She is an amazing host, who is open to socializing but also gives you your personal space. She was very friendly, helpful, and flexible. The flat is clean and tidy, and quiet during the night. The city center is just a short walk away, the coach station is roughly 12 minutes, the train station 30 on foot. There are two friendly, furry lodgers though, which, if you like dogs is a big plus, if you don't, it's a no-go. I really enjoyed the company of the doggies and already miss them hanging around. All in all, it is a very cozy place, where you'll likely feel like home very quickly.

Lis is a fabulous host and after a warm welcome (in the early hours) I immediately felt relaxed in her home. Lis is an extremely friendly & genuine person with a super cosy flat & two gorgeous dogs. I loved my room & private amenities & thoroughly enjoyed my weeks stay. A real home from home.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her Airbnb to anyone visiting Bristol.

Lis does stand out as an exceptionally friendly host. I enjoyed my time with her so much (and not just because there were dogs everywhere...;) ). Lovely little room and bathroom, great (quiet) flat and perfect location for me as I needed to go to the University every day.Absolutely loved staying there, thank you!

We had a lovely stay, would definitely recommend to anybody. We were only there for one night and it was a great location, we wandered into the centre easily. Lis is a lovely host, she was very accommodating and  made us feel really comfortable. The room itself was lovely and clean and there was a separate bathroom for us. I would definitely recommend this - it is one of the best Airbnb's I have visited!

I can’t recommend staying at Lis’ home more. It was a fantastic experience. I felt like I was at home from day one. Lis is accommodating, flexible, caring, chatty and most importantly, makes a great Spanish omelette! Everything was clean, loads of options for breakfast and Mia and Benji are the sweetest dogs (and hosts).Lis is great company and always happy to chat, and at the same time is more than happy to let you have your personal space. Having your own bathroom is also a great bonus.I’ll be staying in contact with Lis and coming back.Thanks Lis, Mia and Benji x

Loved my stay here, Lis has two adorable dogs, Mia and Benji. If you are an animal lover you will like staying here. Lis was very helpful and easy to communicatekeep in touch with. The area is just off Stokes Croft which is one of the most culturally vibrant areas in the city. At the same time it's quiet at night with surrounding gardens. Would happily stay again.

Lis was an excellent host and made me feel very welcome! The apartment is very nice, with your own bathroom and a lovely lounge kitchen space. Really homely and Lis is so accommodating to your needs. Breakfast being included is a bonus and Lis is always keen to chat. I spent 2 weeks there, the location is excellent in a very culture-rich area and short walks to the centre. The dogs aren't a particularly imposing feature either. Thanks Lis, would definitely recommend to anyone needing a base to explore Bristol from.

I spent 3 nights in her place and it was really great. It's 15mn walk from the center and there is a lot of little shops just next street. Lis is a great host who will make sure your comfortable in her place.Obviously don't go there if you really don't like dogs or if you are allergic, but if you are ok with them, Benji and Mia are very friendly so don't be scared !

Lisa's place has to be one of my favourite Air BnB stays, welcoming, yet not intrusive, wonderful space in my favourite part of Bristol. And of course the wonderful Mia and Benji to cuddle!

Lis is very warm-hearted person and she very welcomed us from at the first and even at the end. Her house is in the Stokes croft area which is the hippiest and the coolest place in Bristol. I definitely enjoyed staying this area and was satisfied with her place. Her dogs are really adorable and didn’t bother us.   I appreciate her kind hospitality and would get back again. ;)

Lis is such a friendly and welcoming host, she really made myself and my friend feel at home when we stayed overnight on a visit to Bristol. Her dogs are really well behaved and she gave us loads of helpful tips of where to visit and local places to eat. Would definitely stay again.

I had a lovely stay at Lis's place. The room is very quiet, light and airy and it's wonderful having the private bathroom. The flat is in St Paul's, a very lively multicultural area which is a short walk from the centre. A great plus point for me was the residents' parking just outside the house for which Lis kindly gave me a permit. Lis is very helpful. communicative and interesting - and her dogs are adorable. Highly recommended.

We had a really nice time in Bristol, the flat location was perfect - just around the corner from all the nightlife, but very quiet at night.Thank you Lis for the recommendations on nice places to eat (the Bristolian had themost excellent breakfast!) and letting us sleep in on the checkout day,it was much appreciated after the late night out! Hope to visit again soon!

this was my first time using airbnb and my first time in Bristol and my first time on holiday by myself. And I couldn't have asked for a better host than Liz. check in was so easy and she gave me  information about the area. Liz was available if I needed anything and is so friendly. It's s good area to base yourself espically if like me you like street art and independent shops.  And benji and Mia are such sweet dogs. They would both come and see me in the evenings. you would have to try hard to find a nicer place too stay. Thank you Liz so much. And the food was wonderful.

Lis is very nice person, good at communication and considerate. Mia and Benji are very friendly too. We have very nice time together. Everything was on time and organised. Great host. I learned a lot things about Spain from her. The house location was quite good. Easy to find, 10 to 15 mins walk to the city centre and coach station.
